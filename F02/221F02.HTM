|  |       |       |       | Helps:                             |
|  |       |       |       | To use Matlab as requested in part |
|  |       |       |       | b of problem 5.2.1 I recommend that|
|  |       |       |       | you use a function M-file for each |
|  |       |       |       | function.  Sometimes Matlab will   |
|  |       |       |       | not have the function you need.    |
|  |       |       |       | In that case you need to write your|
|  |       |       |       | own m-file to extend Matlab's      |
|  |       |       |       | capability.                        |
|  |       |       |       |     As an example, here is a       |
|  |       |       |       | function M-file for a <A HREF="u.m">step</A>.        |
|  |       |       |       | (Right-click on the link, and save |
|  |       |       |       | the M-file to your current         |
|  |       |       |       | directory in Matlab.  You can read |
|  |       |       |       | M-files with Notepad, M-editor, etc|
|  |       |       |       | but it will probably be unformatted|
|  |       |       |       | if you try to read it via your web |
|  |       |       |       | browser.)  Be sure to read the help|
|  |       |       |       | comments in the file.              |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |

|  |       |       |       |       page 23 again.  Also, rect(t)|
|  |       |       |       |       is an alternative way to     |
|  |       |       |       |       denote the unit pulse.       |

|  |       |       |       | sgn(t) is the signum function.     |
|  |       |       |       |       the notation in our text is  |
|  |       |       |       |       just as standard as sin(t).  |
|  |       |       |       |       In Matlab it is called       |
|  |       |       |       |       sign. Try "help sign".       |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | 5.2.2 Sometimes you can find good  |
|  |       |       |       |       M-files on the web.  Here is |
|  |       |       |       |       <A HREF="SINC.M">one I found</A>.  However, the   |
|  |       |       |       |       point of the problem is to   |
|  |       |       |       |       learn how to write these     |
|  |       |       |       |       files, not how to find them. |
|  |       |       |       |       Since reading the work of    |
|  |       |       |       |       others is instructive, you   |
|  |       |       |       |       may use found files. (If they|
|  |       |       |       |       are not from a classmate!)   |
|  |       |       |       |       In that case, be sure they   |
|  |       |       |       |       work right and give credit   |
|  |       |       |       |       where due.  (The web is full |
|  |       |       |       |       of crappy examples, out-dated|
|  |       |       |       |       info, and just plain errors.)|

|  |       |       |       | a weighted sum of basis functions  |
|  |       |       |       | in the form of one of the synthesis|

|  |       |       |       | The F.S. coefficients are a series |

All tests will be closed book.  No crib sheets, calculators or 
computers will be allowed.  Copies of certain tables of 
transforms and properties will be provided with the tests.  You 
will be told which tables these are about a week in advance of 
the test.

Test #1, Friday 10/18.  Covered Chapters 1-6. Handed back 11/1.

Test #2, Friday 11/22.  Covered Chapters 7.  Tables 7.6.3 and
     7.6.3 were provided at the test along with a table of 
     trigonometric ID's.  Handed back on 11/25.

Final exam, Saturday 12/14, 10:30 am - 12:30 pm.  Will cover the 
     content of tests 1 and 2 above, plus sections 8.1 through 
     8.5 of Chapter 8, all of Chapter 9, and sections 10.1 
     through 10.4 of chapter 10.  In addition to the tables given
     with tests #1 and #2, Tables 9.6.1 (corrected) and 9.6.2 
     will be provided at the test.

Page 3,   12 lines of text up from the bottom of the page, 
          "Its" should be "It is". 

Page 25,  Definition 2.2.6:  Change "t + 1/2" to "1 + 2t" also
                             Change "1/2 - t" to "1 - 2t".

Page 121, The last sentence of text on this page reads:
          "ratio of the input signal over the output signal. . ."
          It should read:
          "ratio of the output signal over the input signal. . ."

Page 286, There are two problems labeled "9.2.1."  The first of 
          these should be labeled "9.1.2."  (This one is noted in
          (Lindner's list of errata, but he does not note that 
          there are two such problems, only one of which has the
          error in it.)

Page 341, In problem 10.1.9 two labels are missing from 
          equations.  The equation 7 lines from the bottom of the 
          page (Just under "Summing the forces on the mass we 
          obtain" should be labeled "i.)".  The equation 5 lines 
          from the bottom of the page (Just under, "Rewriting 
          this equation in terms of <i>z</i>(<i>t</i>) yields" 
          should be labeled "ii.)".  These labels are used in 
          part (a) of the problem.
