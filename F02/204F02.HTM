|  |       |       |       | the clock starts at logic-0.  Let  |
|  |       |       |       | J=K=1 for all time.  Use a timing  |
|  |       |       |       | diagram in the style of Figure 4-11|
|  |       |       |       | to illustrate what the outputs of  |
|  |       |       |       | the master and slave latches do.   |

|  |       |       |       | DA = sum of minterms 1, 4, 5, 6.   |
|  |       |       |       | Then DA = A*Xbar + Bbar*X          |

General information about the lab <A target="_blank"
HREF="http://denis.dordt.edu/academics/departments/engineering/labguide.htm">equipment and procedures</A>.

Information on Altera licensing is available <A 
HREF="http://www.altera.com/support/licensing/lic-university.html">here</A>.
Choose version 10.1.  After you get the license file via e-mail, 
start MAX+Plus II (ignore warnings about the license file) and 
from the options menu, choose license setup.  Note the path to 
the license file.  Exit MAX+Plus II.  Use Windows Explorer or a 
similar program to replace the old license file with the new one.  
Restart MAX+Plus II--now it should work. 

Report #1 was assigned on 9/23.  Report on the "Combinational 
     logic" lab.  The report must include a complete schematic.  
     The report was due in class on Wednesday, 10/23.  (On 10/2 
     the due date was extended from 10/9 to 10/16.  On 10/11 it 
     was again extended to 10/23.)  Handed back on 11/18.

     A booklet on how to write a lab report was handed out in 
     class on 10/11.  An electronic file of it is available <A 
     HREF="204F02LR.DOC">here</A>.  
     (It will not print, display, or paginate perfectly on 
     Dordt's installation of Microsoft Word 2000.  It is designed 
     to print folio style which is not supported and it uses some 
     unsupported fonts.) 

     You may improve your grade.  Here is what you need to do:     
     
     1.)  Read the comments in your graded report.  "WLR" refers 
     to the booklet mentioned above.  "WFC" refers to the book 
     "Write for College."  (This is item [3] in the reference 
     section of WLR.)  
     
     2.)  Edit to improve the worst element of the grade.  The 
     three elements, "Completeness," "Style," and "Accuracy," are 
     described in WLR on page 6.  
     
     3.)  Turn the improved report back in on or before Dec. 11 
     along with the original marked-up version of the report.  
     Professor De Boer will regrade one element of the report, 
     average the new grade with the old grade, and recompute the 
     report grade.  
     
     Example:  The original grading is, "Completeness: B+, 
     Style: F, Accuracy: A, Report Grade D+."  
     
     The report grade was brought down by the poor grade for 
     Style.  Suppose that after editing, the Style grade 
     becomes A-.  The average of A- (new grade) and F (old grade) 
     is C.  The Report grade becomes the average of B+, C, and A.  
     The final and only entry in the grade book for this report 
     is B.  The B counts toward 7 percent of the course grade.  
     (Report #2 on your state machine design counts for another 8 
     percent giving the lab a total weight of 15 percent.)

     A second example:  The original grading is, 
     "Completeness: C, Style: C, Accuracy: C, Report Grade: C."  
     The authors decide to improve the Accuracy of the report.  
     Suppose the regraded paper gets an accuracy grade of B+.  
     The average of B+ and C is B-.  The report grade becomes the 
     average of C, C and B-.  The final report grade is C+. 



Report #2 Was assigned on 11/4.  It was a report on the 
     "Synchronous State Machine" lab.  It was due in class on 
     Wednesday, 12/4.  You were requested to read the comments on 
     your graded Lab report #1 before turning in Report #2.  
     Report #2 was handed back on 12/12.


                              TESTS                  Last Update:
                              -----             11/25 at  2:19 pm
All the tests and the final exam will be closed book with no crib 
     sheets, no calculators, no computers allowed.

Test #1, Friday 10/18, Covered Chapters 1, 2 and 3 except for 
     a few paragraphs on transmission gates on pages 81 and 82 and 
     sections 3-13, and 3-14 of Chapter 3.  A good pencil and an 
     eraser were recommended.  Handed back on 10/30.
     
Test #2, Wednesday 11/20, Covered Chapter 4 through the end of 
     Chapter 6, except for sections on HDL's.  The information 
     covered by Test #1 was prerequisite knowledge for this test.  
     The test was closed book, no notes, no calculators.  A good 
     pencil and an eraser were recommneded.  Handed back 11/25.

Final Exam, Saturday, 12/14, 8-10 am.  The exam will cover the 
     entire course.  See the reading assignment list to see what 
     the course covered.  The final exam will omit the sections 
     on HDL's, specifically sections 3-13, 3-14, 4-8, 4-9, 5-7, 
     5-8. The final exam will be in the same style and format as 
     the tests, except for the longer time (2 hours).


                   ERRATA LIST for the TEXTBOOK      Last Update:
                   --------------------------11/28/01 at  5:05 pm

This list is for the "Second Edition, Updated, 2nd printing."  
     
To find out if you have this version, first look on the cover for 
"2ND EDITION UPDATED" in red print under the title.  Then turn to 
page ii (the page before the table of contents) and look for a 
list of numbers like "10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3."  The last digit that is 
missing, "2" in the example above, is the printing.  (Each time 
the book is printed, one of the numbers in this list is removed.)  

Kime (an author of this book) also maintains <A HREF 
="http://cwx.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/mano/chapter0/custom2/deluxe-content.html">other lists of errata</A> 
for this book, including other editions and printings. 

p222 Fig. 4-28 Labels on two flip-flops are missing.  Starting at 
     the "FJKC" labels and going clockwise, the labels are Q, 
     CLR, CK, K, J.  Each label to be placed inside the box that 
     represents the flip-flop.  Also note: the use of the 
     inverter at the output of the lower flip-flop is poor 
     practice.  Use the Qbar output of the flip-flop instead. 

p289 line 13 from the top, change "$" to "=".  Optional:  Add a 
     marginal note: k = log(base2)(m).

p300 line 7 from the bottom.  Change "32800" to "32783" and 
     change "608" to "591".  (2^15 AND gates + 15 inverters = 
     32783 gates.  2^9 AND gates + 9 inverters + 2^6 AND gates + 
     6 inverters = 591 gates.  Compare to Fig. 3-13, p112.) 

p310 line 3 from bottom.  Change "PDL" to "PLD."

p320 line 12 from bottom (an equation).  
     Change "(0,5,6,7" to "(0,5,6,7)" (add a closing parenthesis) 

p375 Figure 7-20.  Signal AA is "0" instead of "6" in clock cycle 
     2.  Signal BA is "6" instead of "0" in clock cycle 2 only.  
     Signal BA remains "0" in clock cycles 3 and 4.  A crossover 
     ("X") is missing in signal BA between clock cycles 2 and 3.   
     A corrected figure appears in PDF format in Kime's <A HREF = " 
     http://www.woodchuckimages.com/mano/errata_up_2.pdf">errata</A>
     <A HREF = " 
     http://www.woodchuckimages.com/mano/errata_up_2.pdf">list</A>. 

p391 and following:  This errata list does not completely cover 
     p391 and following, Chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11.  See Kime's
     <A HREF="http://www.woodchuckimages.com/mano/errata_up_2.pdf">errata list</A> for additional errata on these chapters.  

p505 Problem 9-1 change "Section 9-1" to "Section 9-2."

p509 Problem 9-26 change "y=0.3x" to "y is about 0.3 x."

p649 Index entry for "Three-state buffers" change p298 to p296.

p643-650 In the index, most page numbers are wrong, generally 
     about 2 to 6 pages too high.
