In this story version of the problem statements I shall repeat 
the problem statements using only words.  Although there will be 
almost no mathematical symbolism to speed your way, perhaps you 
will find hints of what the equations in the problem statements 
mean&mdash;hints that may be hard for students to pick up on 
until they gain a deeper understanding of the symbolism of the 
equations.  <br><br>

<b>Problem two-point-thirty-one.</b><br>   
By replacing the general input signal <i>x</i> with the unit-step input
signal in the convolution integral, prove that the response of a 
linear-time-invariant system to the unit step function as the 
input to the system is found by integrating the system's 
impulse response from minus infinity to the time-instant at 
which you would like to know what the output is.<br><br>

<b>Problem two-point-thirty-four-point-one</b><br>
Use the convolution integral to compute the convolution of 
an exponential-times-a-unit-step with an identical 
exponential-times-a-unit-step.  Let one exponential times a unit step play 
the role of the input <i>x</i> and the other play the role of the 
impulse response <i>h</i> in the convolution integral.  Evaluate the 
integral in a piecewise fashion according to the various overlap 
conditions found by the mirror-and-slide technique.  Hint:  
The overlap conditions allow you to replace the infinite 
limits of integration in the convolution integral with finite 
limits that are valid only in a defined range of the amount 
of slide, which is <i>t</i>.  Also remember that <i>t</i> is not 
the index of integration.  That will hopefully simplify 
the integral considerably for you. <br><br> 

<b>Problem two-point-thirty-four-point-two</b><br>
Use the convolution integral to compute the convolution of 
a unit rectangle function with a unit triangle function.  
Let the unit rectangle play the role of the input <i>x</i> and 
let the unit triangle play the role of the impulse response 
<i>h</i> in the convolution integral.  Evaluate the 
integral in a piecewise fashion according to the various overlap 
conditions found by the mirror-and-slide technique.  Hint:  
The overlap conditions allow you to replace the infinite 
limits of integration in the convolution integral with finite 
limits that are valid only in a defined range of the amount 
of slide, which is <i>t</i>.  Also remember that <i>t</i> is not 
the index of integration.  That will hopefully simplify 
the integral considerably for you. <br><br>

<b>Problem two-point-thirty-five</b><br>
Prove that for a causal (what does "causal" mean?) 
linear-time-invariant system, the convolution integral's 
bounds can be modified by changing either the lower bound
(from minus infinity) to zero or the upper bound (from 
infinity) to <i>t</i>.
