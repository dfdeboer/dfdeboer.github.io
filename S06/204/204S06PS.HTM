|  |       |       |       | Hint on 11-24:  The computer sets  |
|  |       |       |       | flag bits the same no matter what  |
|  |       |       |       | number format is in use.  The      |
|  |       |       |       | computer is not a person--it does  |
|  |       |       |       | not "know" what format the data is |
|  |       |       |       | representing.  In particular, the  |
|  |       |       |       | answers to parts (c) and (d) do not|
|  |       |       |       | depend in any way on the number    |
|  |       |       |       | formats in use.  The CPU treats all|
|  |       |       |       | data the same.  The programmer     |
|  |       |       |       | selects instructions based on the  |
|  |       |       |       | number formats in use.             |

|  |       |       |       | This assignment will be graded and |

                                   >supplement to Table 11-7</A>|  
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Do *11-17, also repeat 11-17 except|
|  |       |       |       | start with 0110 1000 in the        |
|  |       |       |       | register and the carry bit set to  |
|  |       |       |       | logic-1 AND reverse the order      |
|  |       |       |       | of the instructions.  In other     |
|  |       |       |       | words, the first instruction is    |
|  |       |       |       | ROLC, then RORC, etc. to SHR as the|
|  |       |       |       | last instruction.                  |
|  |       |       |       | Also do *11-23, *11-25             |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Hint:  For problem *11-23 assume   |
|  |       |       |       | that the "16 bit register" is named|
|  |       |       |       | register "R".                      |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Hint: For problem *11-25 a computer|
|  |       |       |       | does subtraction A - B as A + (-B) |
|  |       |       |       | and treats the numbers as twos     |
|  |       |       |       | complement no matter what format   |
|  |       |       |       | they are actually in.  Then        |
|  |       |       |       | "borrow" is the NOT of the carry   |
|  |       |       |       | out of that addition.  This borrow |
|  |       |       |       | is saved in the carry flag bit.    |

|  |       |       |       | Zero can be formed as the exclusive|
|  |       |       |       | OR of two identical words.  For    |
|  |       |       |       | example, R0 XOR R0 = 0.            |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |

|  |       |       |       | <A HREF=
"http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tibpal16r4-25c.pdf"
                        >TIBPAL16L8 datasheet</A>.              |

|  |       |       |       | Hint #1:  The output pins of the   |
|  |       |       |       | TIBPAL16L8-25C are driven by       |
|  |       |       |       | inverters.  You need to build the  |
|  |       |       |       | inverse function in the array to   |
|  |       |       |       | get the true function at the output|
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Hint #2:  If you put an "X" mark on|
|  |       |       |       | an AND gate it signifies that all  |
|  |       |       |       | the fuses on all the inputs for    |
|  |       |       |       | that AND gate should remain intact.|
|  |       |       |       | This forces the output of that AND |
|  |       |       |       | gate to logic-0 always.            |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Hint #3:  Tie pin 1 to ground.  Use|

Note 1) Homework must be ready for peer grading and discussion in
class on the first listed due date.  It must be turned in for a
final grade on the second listed due date.  Peer grading will be
1/5 (20%) of the homework grade.

Note 2) If a "#" follows the "returned" date, then the solution
key is posted on the cork board across the hall from room S233.

Note 3) Problems sets shown above with no "assigned" date are
tentative.  More problems might be added, expected due dates
might change, but problems shown will eventually be assigned.
