|10|  4/19 |  4/28 |       | 5.1, 5.2 parts (a) and (c) only.   |
|  |       |       |       | 5.3, 5.25, 6.8, 6.11 but do only   |
|  |       |       |       | the decimation in time part.       |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Hints: For some problems, e.g. 5.2,|
|  |       |       |       | Matlab can take the drudgery out   |
|  |       |       |       | of the math.  For 6.11 you can keep|
|  |       |       |       | the twiddle factors in exponential |
|  |       |       |       | form as multipliers until the last |
|  |       |       |       | step, when you expand them to      |
|  |       |       |       | complex numbers to express the     |
|  |       |       |       | results of the FFT.  A further hint|
|  |       |       |       | on 6.11: X(2) = 0 and several other|
|  |       |       |       | terms are zero too.  (Which ones?) |
|  |       |       |       | Note:  The signal has _______      |
|  |       |       |       | symmetry in the time domain.       |

| 9|  3/27 |  4/07 |  4/14#| 4.9, 4.10, 4.14, 4.15              |
|  |       |       |       | Hint on 4.14: What is the sum of   |
|  |       |       |       | all the x(n) over all n?           |
|  |       |       |       | Hints on 4.15: What is X(0) = ?    |
|  |       |       |       | What is dX(w)/dw = when evaluated  |
|  |       |       |       | at w = 0? (w = omega).             |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | On Monday, 4/3, the due date was   |
|  |       |       |       | extended from 4/3 to 4/7.          |

| 8|  2/27 |  3/06 |  3/29#| 4.4, 4.5, 4.8                      |
|  |       |       |       | Note:  In 4.4 the period, N = 6    |

| 7|  2/20 |  2/27 |  3/1? | Study for test on Wed. 2/22.       |
|  |       |       |       | Also do 3.21 (a proof).            |
|  |       |       |       | Hint:  Assume the polynomial has a |
|  |       |       |       | complex root.  Show that the       |
|  |       |       |       | conjugate of the polynomial has    |
|  |       |       |       | a root which is the conjugate of   |
|  |       |       |       | the original root of the original  |
|  |       |       |       | polynomial.  Then show that the    |
|  |       |       |       | original polynomial must have the  |
|  |       |       |       | conjugate of the original root too.|
|  |       |       |       | Put these hints together to make a |
|  |       |       |       | complete proof.                    |

|  |       |       |       |                                    |

| 5|  2/06 |  2/13 |  2/21 | 2.62* parts (a) through (d) only.  |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Hints:  Try "help randn" in Matlab.|
|  |       |       |       | Crosscorrelation can be done via   |
|  |       |       |       | matlab's "conv" function.          |
|  |       |       |       | If x and y are equal size,         |
|  |       |       |       | Rxy = conv(x, fliplr(y));          |
|--+-------+-------+-------+------------------------------------|
| 4|  2/01 |  2/06 |  2/15 | 2.22*, 2.25, 2.26 (assume relaxed),|
|  |       |       |       | 2.43 part (a) only.                |
|--+-------+-------+-------+------------------------------------|
| 3|  1/23 |  1/30 |  2/03 | 2.11, 2.16, 2.20*                  |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Note:  Part (a) of 2.16 is a proof.|
|  |       |       |       | For part (b) do at least sub-parts |
|  |       |       |       | 1, 2, and 3 by hand.  For finite   |
|  |       |       |       | numeric computations Matlab has a  |
|  |       |       |       | command called "conv" which works  |
|  |       |       |       | well for most of this problem.  For|
|  |       |       |       | some parts Matlab cannot be used.  |
|  |       |       |       | Do those parts by hand.            |

|  |       |       |       | Hint for 1.16*--> You may use the  |

                        >quantize.m</A> file in your program.   |
|  |       |       |       | Note: quantize.m requires <A HREF =
                              "matlab/limit.m">limit.m</A>  |
|  |       |       |       | be stored in the same folder.      |

 * = A computer is highly recommended for solving this problem.

Notes: To save a copy of a *.m file, right-click the link and 
       then click on something like "save target as. . ." (the
       exact procedure depends on your web browser.)

       To read a *.m file with it's original formatting, after 
       clicking on the link select "View | Source" or similar 
       command from the top menu bar of your browser.  (If this
       exprience does not prove the value of white space, which
       browsers typically remove, nothing will.)
