|10|  4/11 |  4/28 |       | Read Chapter 8 Sections 8.1 and 8.2|
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Do repeat the analysis in Fig. 8.11|
|  |       |       |       | and on page 422 of your text but   |
|  |       |       |       | refine the analysis by modeling the|
|  |       |       |       | input resistance of the '14 Schmitt|
|  |       |       |       | trigger as a 1 kohm resistance from|
|  |       |       |       | the '14's input through the '14 to |
|  |       |       |       | the +5 V supply.  How does this    |
|  |       |       |       | change the delta_t time?           |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Do adapt the design shown in Fig.  |
|  |       |       |       | 8.31b to replace the 75491 driver  |
|  |       |       |       | with a PN2222 transistor.  Note    |
|  |       |       |       | that if the 68HC11's output pin is |
|  |       |       |       | logic-1 the pin can source up to   |
|  |       |       |       | 0.8 mA.  If the 68HC11's output pin|
|  |       |       |       | is logic-0 the pin can sink up to  |
|  |       |       |       | 1.6 mA.  Adapt the design again to |
|  |       |       |       | use a PN2907 transistor.  Which    |
|  |       |       |       | design do you recommend?  (Use the |
|  |       |       |       | transistor data inside the back    |
|  |       |       |       | cover of your textbook.) Assume the|
|  |       |       |       | LED is type "P300" which is equiv. |
|  |       |       |       | to Lumex type <A HREF=

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
Note 1) If a "#" follows the "returned" date, then the solution
key is posted on the cork board across the hall from room S233.

Note 2) Problems sets shown above with no "assigned" date are
tentative.  More problems might be added, expected due dates
might change, but problems shown will eventually be assigned.

Note 3) If you are having difficulty reading the latest version
of this page it may have to do with your browser's cached memory.
Read this <A HREF=
"../../ddb/notes00.htm">note on cached pages</A> to solve the 
problem. 

Note 4) Class did not meet on 1/19 due to the ASME tour.  Thus
PS #1 was handed back at the next class meeting after it was due.
