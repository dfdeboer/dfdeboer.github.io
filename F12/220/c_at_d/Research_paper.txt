RESEARCH PAPER

Write a paper on the role of a goverment agency (e.g. the Federal Energy Reglulatory Commission--FERC) or a quazi-government agency (e.g. the Electric Power Research Institute--EPRI, or the North American Electric Reliabiliity Corporation--NERC) in regulating the electric power industry or doing fundamental research directed at discovering methods of regulation or the setting of standards for the industry. 

Your paper should open with a thesis statement of no more than 100 words.  (The Thesis may be part of an introductory paragraph that is longer than 100 words.) The thesis must be debatable. 

Your paper must be in IEEE format and must draw on at least three independent sources that are either books, peer-reviewed journal articles, or industry trade publications.  (One of each or any combination adding up to a total of three.)  You may also reference any additoinal number of different sources such as newspapers, poplular magazines, and web pages. The anticipated length of the paper is about 8 pages, double-spaced in 10 point Times New Roman typeface with one inch margins all around, but no particular page count, margin, or typeface is required.  What is required is that the body of the paper defends the debatable thesis statement.
