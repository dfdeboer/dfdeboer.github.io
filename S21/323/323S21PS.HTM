Our Textbook, <i>Microelectronic Circuits</i>, by Sedra, Smith, 
<i>et. al.</i>, includes four kinds of problem solving.  Generally 
only the first kind described here, "<i><b>Problems</b></i>" 
are assigned.<br><br>

a.)  <b><i><u>Problems</u></i> are found at the end of each chapter.  
All the assignments refer to "Problems" at the end of the 
chapter unless they are prefixed with "Ex".</b>  Example:  The 
first problem assigned in this class, 1.5, is found on page 46.  
<b>Problem</b> 1.5 starts with the phrase, "In the analysis. . ."  
If you are looking at something else, it is not the assigned problem. 
(Ex1.5 is found on page 12 and Ex1.5 is not the assigned problem).<br><br>
 
b.) <i><u>Exercises</u></i> are  embedded throughout the body 
of the chapter contents.  These have answers, but not complete 
solutions.  Students should challenge themselves to solve some 
of these exercises.  A few of these may be assigned as homework.  
If so, on this page their number will be prefixed with "Ex".  
The first exercise, Ex1.1, starts near the bottom of page 8.<br>
<b>Exercise</b> 1.1 starts with the phrase, "For the 
signal-source. . ."<br><br>

c.) <i><u>Examples</u></i> are embedded throughout the body 
of the chapter contents. These have complete written solutions in 
the textbook.  Some of the homework may parallel these examples.  
The first example, Example 1.1, is on page 7.
<b>Example</b> 1.1 starts with the phrase, "The output resistance. . ."<br><br>

d.) <i><u>Video Examples</u></i> are embedded throughout the body  
of the chapter contents.  These have complete solutions presented 
via video accessed by Web.  Some of the homework may parallel 
these video examples. The first video example is on page 5.  
<b>Video Example</b> VE1.1 starts with the phrase, "For the circuit
shown. . ." Some of the video examples are free and some are paid 
"premium" content.  Students should watch some of these, choosing 
especially the video examples on topics that are found challenging.  
However, the "premium content" need not be purchased.  You can 
always ask Professor De Boer about topics you find challenging.

Discussion in class is an important part of working the 
assignments.  After the first few assignments, most of the 
homework for this class will be too complex to do in one sitting.  
Students must be prepared to discuss the assignments in class 
starting with the class following the "Assigned" date.

A "+" mark in front of the problem number on this page means an 
answer is provided in an online appendix to the textbook.  The
"+" marks do not appear in the textbook.  Solutions are in 
<a href="https://oup-arc.com/protected/files/content/file/1579527329609-Sedra8e_AppL.pdf"

The letter "D" in front of a problem number indicates a 
design-oriented problem.  The student may need to use some 
judgement in understanding what the problem statement is 
requesting.  (Ask Prof. De Boer if you are in doubt.)

Asterisks (*) indicate more difficult or more time-consuming 
problems (in the authors' judgement).  The more asterisks, the 
more difficult.

We will turn homework in electronically this semester.  Click 
a due date (the due dates are links) to get instructions from 
canvas for turning your work in.  The recommended format is a 
single pdf file from a scanner.  Another alternative is a a 
word-processor file (docx for example) with photos from a 
smartphone of your homework pasted into the document.  If you 
use this alternative, please consider using a "mobile scanner 
app" in your smartphone to get a nice contrasty picture of 
each homework page.
