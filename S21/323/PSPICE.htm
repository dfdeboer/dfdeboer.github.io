<b>Click the icon-button above to access PSpice AD Lite on a 
remote server.</b>  Typically you must log into the remote server
and give Windows permission to make the connection, so you will be
asked for logon credentials more then once.  </p><p>

PSpice AD Lite will be running on a remote computer but will 
appear in a window on your computer as if it is running on 
your computer.  Normally the file tree for this program will be
focused on the remote computer's file system.  Within the remote-loaded 
PSpice program the "C:\" drive is not your local drive, it is the
drive on which the remote server is running.  Look instead for 
a drive labeled <br>
"C on &lt;your computer's name&gt;" or something 
similar.  Other drives attached via a network to your local 
machine will usually also appear in the file tree as 
"G on. . ." or similar. </p><p>

If you get a dialog box about a license file that is missing, 
tick the box about not asking again and then click on "YES."
The program will then run without a license.  (Running without 
a license places limitations on the number of nodes, etc.  You 
will not hit these limits in assigned course work, or if 
you do, you have made a mistake.)  </p><br><br><br>

<b>PSice is loaded on most engineering lab computers.</b><br>
Professor De Boer thinks it is most convenient to do your PSpice 
work on one of Dordt's computers so that you do not have to 
install PSpice.  However a <i>trial version</i> is available for 
free.  You may download it and install it on your personal
computer at your option.</p><p>

<b>The trial version has all the features and capabilities of the 
regular version and no expiration date.</b>  However it does limit 
the number of circuit elements that may be included in a 
simulation.  This restriction has never been an issue with work
done by students here at Dordt.  Thus, for the purposes of this 
course, you would never be able to tell the difference between 
the trial version and the regular version.               </P><p>

<b>To get started downloading, click on the PSpice logo</b> (the image 
above).  There you can read more about the program.  You will have 
to set up an account.  PSpice is a part of a larger software package 
called OrCAD.  Initially, follow directions to download either Orcad 
or Pspice.  Either choice will lead to the same options.  You will 
receive an e-mail with directions for performing the download.<br><br>

<b>OrCAD PSpice A/D: </b>  (Recommended) If you only want to use the 
software to do homework for this class, you  only need to install 
the "OrCAD PSpice A/D" portion of the software.  By not installing 
the entire OrCAD package you will save several GB of storage on your
hard drive.</p><p>
                                               
<b>PSpice was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29"
>forked</a> from an earlier program called SPICE.</b>  You can
read more about SPICE <a href="http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/classes/IcBook/SPICE/"
>here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE"
>here</a>.  Practically all commands and features of spice are 
supported in the A/D Lite version of PSpice that we use here at 
Dordt University.  <b>Thus documentation for SPICE can be used with 
and applied to PSpice.</b></p><p>
