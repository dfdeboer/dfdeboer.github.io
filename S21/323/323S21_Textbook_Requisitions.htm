<h1>Additional notes</h1>

<p>Any one of the three choices of textbooks listed above is sufficient for this course.<br>
Each choice (if purchased new) provides identical content.  Only the formats vary.<br>
<br>
If a new hardcover or loose-leaf textbook is purchased it will include a valid access<br> 
code to "locked" content.  However, the access code is not needed for this course.<br>
<br>
If a used hardcover or loose-leaf textbook is purchased you should assume that the <br>
access code that was sold with that book to the original purchaser will not be valid <br>
for you, unless the seller warrants otherwise.  A new access code can be purchased <br>
online for $59.95.  However, the access code is not needed for this course.<br>
<br>
The textbook can be rented from 
<a href="https://www.vitalsource.com/products/microelectronic-circuits-adel-s-sedra-kenneth-c-kc-v9780190853532"
>Vitalsource</a> or <a href="https://www.redshelf.com/book/1504399/microelectronic-circuits-1504399-9780190853532-adel-s-sedra-kenneth-c-kc-smith-tony-chan-carusone-vincent-gaudet"
>Redshelf</a>.  A rental includes a valid <br>
access code to the "locked" content.  The semester duration will be from January 7, <br>
2021 to May 7, 2021, a duration of 120 days.  Understand when your rental days <br>
begin to be counted and be sure the duration will last through May 6.
