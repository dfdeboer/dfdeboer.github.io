<P><B>Homework is for Learning by Showing&mdash;<br>
Grades Are Given For Showing How to Solve</B><a name="Show_How"></a><BR>
The overall goal of doing homework is to learn by showing how 
to solve problems.  On written homework you need to present a 
clear sequence of rational statements to show how a problem 
is solved, not simply a correct answer.  </p><p> 

Skipped steps may be interpreted as a lack of understanding on 
your part and may be graded down accordingly. </p><p> 

If the answer is given (e.g. in the back of the textbook) it is 
essential that you explain how to get the answer.  Oftentimes you 
will use equations and math to show how you solved the problem, 
but sometimes you will need to explain how you solved the problem 
by using a sentence or two. (After all, you cannot expect credit 
for simply copying the answer!) </p><p>

In general, the professor is not interested in the answer. He 
already knows the answer!  You must write something to show 
that <i>you</i> know how to solve the problem.  
</p><p> 



<B>Type of Paper</b><a name="Paper"></a><BR>
                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <i>For homework</i>                            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

   &mdash;Use letter size paper (about 8.5" x 11")<BR>
                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &mdash;Paper ripped out of a spiral binder is not acceptable unless<BR>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       you neatly cut off the ragged edge. <BR> 
                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &mdash;Engineering paper is recommended but not required.
                                         <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   
   <i>For reports and papers</i>          <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &mdash;Use plain white letter size paper (8.5" x 11")

                                                      <br></p><p>
<B>Staple</B><a name="Staple"></a><BR>
Staple your papers together in the upper left corner if there is 
more than one page. 
                                                      <BR></P><P>

<B>One Side Only</B><a name="One_Side_Only"></a><BR>
Write on only one side of each sheet of paper.  Do not write on 
the back side of the paper.  Exception:  Computer-printed pages 
may be printed on both sides in order to conserve paper. </P><P> 

<B>Use a Pencil for Homework&mdash;Learning is an Iterative Process.</B>
                                        <a name="Pencil"></a><BR>
Most engineering problems include too much detail to hold in your 
head without writing intermediate steps down.  Thus you need to 
write in order to think.  This includes any computerized homework
that Prof. De Boer might assign.  You are not expected to be good
at solving computerized homework without using a written aid such
as a pad of paper and a pencil and eraser or a program such as 
Mathcad running along side of the computerized homework.<br><br>  

Mistakes will happen because you need to start writing before 
thinking all the way through the problem.  By using a pencil 
you can erase your mistakes, or if you use a program like 
Mathcad you can delete or edit your mistakes.  Writing, 
thinking, writing more, erasing, re-writing, and so forth is the 
best and <i>fastest</i> way to solve engineering problems.   
Keeping a neat and easy-to-read page by erasing and re-writing is 
the right way to work.  Write a lot and when needed, 
erase (or edit).<p></p> 

A good quality 0.5&nbsp;mm mechanical pencil (e.g. Pentel brand 
<a href= "../Canvas_common/pentel_p205.jpg"
>model P205</a> or equivalent) and a good white plastic eraser 
(e.g. Pentel "<a href= "../Canvas_common/ZE22A_sm.gif"
>Clic</a>") will pay for themselves many times over with time 
saved when used generously.  This equipment is available at the 
<a href=
"http://www.dordt.edu/services_support/bookstore/">Dordt College 
Bookstore</a> and at other local merchants such as <a href=

<i>For Homework</i>                                          <br>
Put at least the course number, problem set number, date, and 
your name at the top of each sheet of paper.  Example:   <BR><BR>

Van VanderVander                                         <br><br>

<i>For Reports</i>                                           <br>
Follow whatever style guide is specified.                    <br>
Prof. De Boer usually specifies IEEE style.           </P><br><P>

<B>Neat Page Layout</B><a name="Neat"></a><BR>
Write legibly.  Consider using white space to set off important 
parts of the problem or answers.  Boxes and underlining can also 
be helpful for the grader.  You may be graded down if the grader 
has difficulty deciphering what you have written or finding an 
answer. On reports, follow the style guide for page layout.</P><P> 

<B>Homework: One Problem Per Page (usually)</B><a name="One_Problem"></a><BR>
Start each new problem at the top of a new page.  Exception: if 
the problem is short enough to finish it on the same page you 
started it.  If the problem takes more than one page, that is 
OK, you may continue on second and subsequent pages if needed, 
but <i>only if the problem started at the top of a new page</i>.  
You may be graded down for violating this rule.  </P><P> 

<B>Homework: Problem Summary Required</B><a name="Summary"></a><BR>
Start each problem with a summary of the problem statement.  As 
an alternative, you may photocopy the problem statement page, cut 
the problem statement out of the photocopy, and paste it onto 
your homework with a glue stick.</P><P>

<B>Units</B><a name="Units"></a><BR>
When a problem statement includes units (seconds, volts, etc.) 
then the answer should include appropriate units. In reports, 
units must be used appropriately.  </P><P>

<B>Significant Digits, No Leading Decimals</B><a name="Sig_Figs"></a><BR>
Use an appropriate number of significant digits.  (If in doubt
on a homework problem, Prof. De Boer will accept 3 significant 
digits unless the answer is obviously an integer quantity or 
unless precision is a specific goal of the problem.) Do not 
allow leading decimals.  (Right: 0.125, Wrong: .125) </P><P>

                 <P align="center"><IMG 
Src="../cd_common/HWSTD/No_Leading_Decimals.gif"><BR>
       <B>Figure 1.  No Leading Decimals!</B></P><P><BR>


<B>Graphs--Label Axes and Make 'em BIG</B><a name="Graphs"></a><BR>
Graphs should be an appropriate size.  If the graph is an answer 
to a homework problem or an illustration in a report, 
this usually means at least two inches high and 3 inches wide.  
It is also necessary that the graph be appropriately scaled.  If 
you can cover the interesting area of the graph with your thumb, 
the graph is either too small or not scaled appropriately.  
<B>Title</B> the graph and <B>label both axes</B> with 
<B>quantity</B> and <B>units</B> where appropriate.  See Figure 2 
below.</P> 

           <P align="center"><IMG 
Src="../cd_common/HWSTD/graph.gif"><BR>
       <B>Figure 2.  An example of a properly labeled <BR>
              graph that is minimally large enough.</B></P><P><BR>

<B>Proofs (Also "Show," "Explain," "Derive," Etc.)</B>
<a name="Proofs"></a><BR>
You cannot convince most people by simply telling them the 
"correct answer."  People want to know more.  Sometimes we need 
proof.  Note:  Words like "show," "explain," "derive," etc. 
usually mean the same thing as "prove."<br><br> 

An engineering proof is a chain of statements leading from given 
information to a conclusion.  This chain of statements must be 
accompanied by the names of the relevant definitions, theorems, 
principles, and so forth.  (In a normal problem solution you only 
show the chain of statements, omitting the names and assuming the 
reader will recognize the definitions, theorems, etc. that have 
been used.)   <BR><BR> 

Engineering is about technical problems in a social context.  
Engineering is not simply applied math and science.  This means 
that an engineering proof needs to convince people by exposing a 
thought process which establishes the believed truth of some 
statement.  Generally, you cannot do a proof by computer because 
the computer does not expose the thought processes, it only gets 
"the right answer."  The "right answer" alone is not convincing.  
</P><P>                                

<B>Use of Calculators and Computers</B><a name="Calculators"></a><BR>
Use calculators and computers appropriately to perform routine 
and tedious operations and calculations.  Computers are also 
ideal for producing clear and accurate graphs.</p><p> 

In sympathy with <a href=
"http://blogs.dordt.edu/ddeboer/2012/05/30/what-calculator-is-best-for-engineering/">engineering department guidelines</a>, Professor De Boer
only allows <a href=
"http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/"
>NCEES approved calculators</a> to be used on tests and final 
exams.  This restriction improves your chances of passing the 
<i>Fundamentals of Engineering Exam</i>.  Professor De Boer highly 
recommends that you take this exam during your senior year.  If you
pass, you can list it on your resume and it can open doors to 
opportunities for you.  (You may use any calculator whatever for 
doing homework.)  </p><p>

If you will not be allowed to use a calculator during the tests, 
consider doing some homework calculations entirely by hand so 
that you are prepared better for the tests.  If you will only
be allowed to use an NCEES approved calculator on the tests, 
consider using your NCEES approved calculator for doing 
homework so that you become well-practiced and efficient when
using that calculator.</P><P> 

You may be graded down for using a calculator or computer to do a 
trivial operation.  For some examples, you should know how to do 
simple definite integrals without needing a calculator.  You 
should also know the sines and cosines of common angles such as 
cos(0) = 1, and you should know simple exponentials and logs such 
as exp(0) = 1 and ln(2<i>e</i>) = ln(2) + 1.  Relying on a 
calculator for these is about as rewarding as watching your friend 
play your favorite video game instead of learning to excel at 
the game yourself.</p><p> 

Never use a computerized symbolic math program (e.g. the 
"symbolics" menu in MathCAD or the equivalent in your calculator) 
to do work that you don't know how to check.  Students who try 
this frequently get the answer wrong, have no way to realize the 
answer is wrong, and never learn how to solve the problem.  Even 
if the answer is in some technical mathematical sense correct, it 
might be in a useless form which betrays your ignorance.  
Example: <br><i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) = exp(<i>it</i>) + 
exp(&ndash;<i>it</i>) when a useful solution is 
<br><i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) = 2cos(<i>t</i>) Those expressions of 
<i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) are technically equivalent, but would you know 
what the first one means? </p><p> 

If you use a computer program (e.g. Mathcad) to help you solve a 
homework problem, you <i>must print the file and staple it to your 
homework</i>.  If you write a program (Matlab, Java, Visual 
Basic, etc.) print the source code (use a fixed pitch font such 
as "Courier New" if you have a choice) and print the output of 
the program too.  On a report the reference to the software 
needs to be documented more carefully than on homework.  Follow 
the style guide for the report.  Missing a printout or a 
reference?  Credit may be denied! </P><P> 

If you use an unusual feature of your calculator when doing
homework, say an equation solver, definite integral solver, or 
matrix inverse operator, make a marginal note.  (e.g. "Used 
matrix inverse on my TI-89 calculator.")  If you use such a 
feature repeatedly, you only need to note your method once, 
near the first instance. On reports the requirements for 
documenting your solution methods will need to follow the
style guide.</p><P>

<B>Reference Books</B><a name="References"></a><BR>
If you use a table of integrals or trig. ID or a theorem or other 
such material from a reference book, you need to cite the source.  
On homework you may do this informally.  (e.g. "Used table of 
integrals in calc. book by Edwards & Penny, 4th edition."  Almost
any style is acceptable if your classmates can reasonably be 
expected to find your source based on your reference.  Subsequent 
citations can be even shorter, e.g. "Integral Table.")  
In a report, a full citation (such as in IEEE or APA or MLA style) 
is required.</P><P>

                                              <a name="DYOW"></a>
<B>Do Your Own Work</B><a name="Do_Your_Own_Work"></a><BR>
Avoiding plagiarism is one aspect of working with
academic integrity, which is more generally discussed in the
Student Handbook (<a href=
"https://www.dordt.edu/campus-life/student-handbook/general-information#Academic%20Integrity"
>section on Academic Integrity</a>).</P><P>  

Keep your papers and computer files private.  The 
only times when you may legitimately share are during peer 
grading in class (if peer grading is offered) and any work done 
in connection with a team in the lab, in which case the team may 
share any of their own materials among themselves whenever the 
result will be a single project or lab report. </P><P> 

Using the Internet to find resource materials to help you 
understand a subject so that you may solve a homework problem is 
acceptable, even laudable.  In contrast, using the Internet to 
find or purchase solutions to copy from (or "work from"), is 
plagiarism.</p><p>

Out-of-the-classroom communications among students about homework 
and other aspects of the class must be verbal or text-based 
(face-to-face or electronic) communications only.  
These communications must be along the lines of helping your 
colleague solve problems for herself or himself.  For example, 
saying, "You need to use such-and-such a theorem to solve that 
problem" is good.  "I think you made a math error because your 
method seems right," is another example of the right type of 
communication.  Even "I got five point nine one for the answer," 
is acceptable.  (Credit is given only for showing how to get 
the answer, not for the answer itself.)  An exception is that 
you may entirely share graded work with classmates who have 
their own graded copy of the same homework assignment. If you 
desire, you may compare your grades and solution techniques.</p><p> 

It is not OK to recite entire equations step-by-step leading to 
the solution.  It is not OK to show your friend your solution or 
a part of your solution before the homework is handed in.  If 
your friend is really stuck, you should probably refer him or 
her to the course instructor for help&mdash;that's what the 
instructor is here for after all.  If you desire more help than 
this rule allows, see the section below, "Help is 
Available."</P><P> 

Policing and prosecuting academic dishonesty is time consuming. 
It is not the professor's responsibility to design an absolutely 
cheat-proof course.  Thus, penalties for those who do get caught
tend to be high in order to serve as a deterent to all.  Students
should be responsible to each other to create an environment of 
integrity in the course.  Professor C.S. Lewis was once asked by 
another professor what he did about plagiarism.  Here is his 
advice, which Prof. De Boer thinks is insightful, especially
the last sentence:  
<blockquote>
   I told him I was not a detective nor even a schoolmaster, nor 
   a nurse, and that I absolutely refused to take any precaution 
   against this puerile trick [copying]; that I'd as soon think it my 
   business to see that he washed behind his ears or wiped his 
   bottom.  He... [dropped out] of his own accord the next week 
   and I never saw him again.  I think you ought to make a 
   general announcement of that sort....  It is bad for them to 
   think this is "up to you." * Flay them alive if you 
   <i>happen</i> to detect them; but don't let them feel that you 
   are a safeguard against the effects of their own idleness.<br> 
       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What staggers me is how any man can 
   prefer the galley-slave labour of transcription** to the 
   freeman's work of attempting [the assignment] on his 
   own.<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    *That is, Lewis believes that professors who worry excessively
     about how their students might be cheating mislead their 
     students to think that "getting answers" (by any means) is 
     more important than deep understanding of the subject.<br><br>                                                       
                                                           
  **By "transcription," Lewis means copying with non-substantive 
    variations so that it looks like your own work.

<b>Help is Available</b><a name="Help"></a><br>
For occasional help, you may call or visit Professor De Boer at 
his office (722-6245) during the daytimes.  You may also call him 
at home Monday through Saturday before 10 PM 
(<img 
src="../cd_common/HWSTD/home_ph.gif">).  
</p><p> 

If you need (or want) help more frequently, consult the secretary 
at the Academic Enrichment Center (AEC) and request "peer tutoring." 
(Or fill in an online form to make the request, see <a 
href="https://dcc.dordt.edu/services/ask_center/peer_tutoring">this 
page</a> and click on the "Tutoring Request Form" link to get 
started.) Professor De Boer believes that the grade of most any 
student can be improved by about a half or a full letter grade 
simply by routine participation in the tutorial services of the 
ASK center.  (Yes, that takes time and work, but it may be worth
it for you.)</p><p> 

Tutorial help is available for many 100 and 200 numbered courses 
at Dordt College, and for some other courses too, so <a 
href="https://dcc.dordt.edu/services/ask_center/peer_tutoring">ask</a>
about it.  When tutorial help is offered for a class, any student 
in the class may participate.  The AEC center is located in the lower 
level of the library.<br><br>
