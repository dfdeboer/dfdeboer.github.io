<p align="center"><b>Three Phase Power<br>
Derived from Single Phase</b></p><p>
If you need three-phase power at your 
		home or farm but only have single-phase power 
		available, there really is no solution as good
		as having three-phase power brought in. But if 
		you insist on running a three-phase machine on 
		single-phase power, you will need a phase converter.  
		These can be purchased from companies such as 
		<a href=
		"http://www.northamericaphaseconverters.com/resources-support/converting-single-phase-power-to-three-phase-power/"
		>this one</a>.</p><p>
		
There is a "home-made" option which can be cost-effective
if a large three-phase induction motor can be obtained at 
a near-salvage price.  Use 
		a small single-phase motor to spin up a large 
		three-phase motor.  Next, energize one phase of 
		the three-phase motor with the single-phase 
		power.  Then switch off the single-phase 
		starter motor but leave one phase of the large three-phase 
		motor connected to the single-phase source.  The large-three-phase 
		motor will now be acting as a motor-generator, with one phase 
		motoring to make the rotor spin and the other two phases generating
		power.  After the motor-generator is started, one may connect a smaller 
		three-phase machine in parallel with the large motor, which is now 
		will acting as <a href=
		"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6eKDsDpup8"
		>a motor-generator combination</a>.  </p><p>
		
The motor used as a motor-generator in the homemade solution needs
to have the correct voltage rating and wye or delta connection.  For example, 
in North America many three-phase machines require 208 V, but the single-phase
power is supplied at 120 or 240 V.  In this case the ideal motor for use as 
the motor generator would be a 208 V wye connected motor with four terminals, 
A, B, C, and N.  Then 120 V single phase power can be applied from A to N and 
terminals B and C will generate the other two phases.  The resulting three-phase 
power will be at 208 V, line-to-line.</p>
