|  |       |       |       | More about p7.4-1:  "Determine"    |
|  |       |       |       | means "find closed-form equations  |
|  |       |       |       | for."  A computer is highly        |
|  |       |       |       | recommended for making the plots.  |
|  |       |       |       | Either Mathcad or Matlab would be  |
|  |       |       |       | a good choice.  In Mathcad, the    |
|  |       |       |       | "if" function might be helpful.    |
|  |       |       |       | You can look it up in the online   |
|  |       |       |       | help system.  An even more elegant |
|  |       |       |       | technique is to use a unit step    |
|  |       |       |       | function (also in Matlab).         |

|  |       |       |       | <A HREF="#ERR_DP6-5">DP6-5</A>.                             |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Note: problem VP2-3 is not in your |
|  |       |       |       | textbook (but the figure for it is)|
|  |       |       |       | The problem is shown below:        |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | VP2-3  The circuit of Figure VP2.2 |
|  |       |       |       | (text page 56) is used to measure  |
|  |       |       |       | the current in a 750 ohm, 1/4 watt |
|  |       |       |       | resistor.  Vs = 1.200 V.  The meter|
|  |       |       |       | is not ideal.  It has a full-scale |
|  |       |       |       | voltage burden of 0.0800 V.  It is |
|  |       |       |       | set to the 2 mA range.  Your lab   |
|  |       |       |       | partner expects the reading to be  |
|  |       |       |       | 1.60 mA.  The reading actully is   |
|  |       |       |       | a little less than that.  The      |
|  |       |       |       | resistor has a tolerance of 2% and |
|  |       |       |       | the meter has an uncertainty of    |
|  |       |       |       | 0.5% of the reading.               |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |

|  |       |       |       | a.) Does this test show the        |
|  |       |       |       |     resistor to be out-of-spec?    |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | b.) What is a best estimate of the |
|  |       |       |       |     actual resistance of the       |
|  |       |       |       |     resistor?                      |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Note:  From the time when VP2-3 was|
|  |       |       |       | originally posted until Monday,    |
|  |       |       |       | 10/25 at 10:17 am there was a typo |
|  |       |       |       | in the posting.  "0.0800 V" was    |
|  |       |       |       | erroniously shown as "0.8000 V."   |
|  |       |       |       | Please correct your work as needed |

Note 1) Homework must be ready for peer grading and discussion in 
class on the first listed due date.  It must be turned in for a 
final grade on the second listed due date.  Peer grading will be 
1/5 (20%) of the homework grade.

Note 2) If a "#" follows the "returned" date, then the solution
key is posted on the cork board across the hall from room S233.

Note 3) Problems sets shown above with no "assigned" date are 
tentative.  More problems might be added, expected due dates 
might change, but problems shown will eventually be assigned.

Announcement: (Made in class Friday, 10/29)  The test originally 
scheduled for Wednesday, 11/3, will be delayed to Friday, 11/5 in 
order to avoid a day when there is also a diffy Q test.  The test
description (<A HREF="#TESTS">below</A>) is up-to-date.

Announcement (9/29, made in class)
The test originally scheduled for Wednesday, 10/6, has been 
rescheduled to the EARLIER date of Monday, 10/4.  

Announcement (8/27 at 2:43 pm)  
An error has been found on the course syllabus and on this web 
page.  The final exam will be on Tuesday, 12/14 at 10:30 am - 
12:30 pm.  (Not on Saturday as previously stated.)  The web 
version of the syllabus and this page have both been corrected.  
Please mark up your hard-copy of the syllabus.

                              TESTS       (Last update: 12/14/04)
                              -----

Test #1, Monday, 10/4, The test covered Chapters 1 through 4.  
   Topics in lab handouts were also be covered, including topics 
   on safety.  Preparation to solve systems of linear algebraic 
   equations with at most three unknowns was expected.  Closed 
   book, closed notes.  A calculator was allowed (and 
   recommended).  You may not store electronic versions of 
   information from your text in your calculator.  If such is 
   discovered, it will be treated as <A 
   HREF="http://www.dordt.edu/cgi-bin/publications/defender/defender.pl?mode=single&section=SLHP&id=2">academic dishonesty</A>.  
   (On Wednesday, 9/29, in class, we decided to move this test
   up from 10/6 to 10/4 because several other classes also have 
   tests on 10/6.)  The test was handed back on Friday, 10/8.

   Avg raw socre was 57.  Min was 21, Max was 99.


Test #2, Wednesday 11/3.  Handed back on Friday, 11/5.
   Test type:  Closed book, closed notes.  A calculator was 
   allowed and recommended.  Same rules as for Test #1 regarding 
   no storage of information in your calculator.  (Here's an 
   <A HREF="http://www.english.uga.edu/nhilton/plagiarismempty.html">interesting quote</A> from C.S. Lewis.)
   
   Coverage:  The test will covered Chapter 5 through Chapter 7 
   Section 7-5, omitting the sections on MATLAB (sections 5-8 and 
   6-9).  Labs were also be covered.  Material covered on Test #1 
   was prerequisite for this test.  

   Avg raw score was 78.  Min was 46, Max was 100.  

Final Exam, Tuesday 12/14 from 10:30 am to 12:30 pm.  
   Test type:  One crib sheet, 8.5" X 11".  A calculator is 
   required.  A calculator that can handle complex numbers is 
   recommended.
   
   Coverage:  The entire course with emphasis on each topic 
   roughly proportional to the time spent on the topic.  
   Knowing how to use complex numbers with your calculator is 
   also recommended.  Tables 9.3-1 and 9-3-2 will be photocopied 
   onto the exam as given information--there is no need to 
   memorize them.  Specific Coverage:  The content of tests #1 
   and #2 plus Chapter 7 Section 7-5 through 7-10, Chapter 8 
   Sections 8-3 through 8-8, Chapter 9 Sections 9-3 through 9-9, 
   Chapter 10 Sections 10-3 through 10-11, Chapter 11 Sections 
   11-3 and 11-4.  Regarding Chapters 8 through 11, if you 
   understand fully how to do the homework assigned for those 
   chapters, you have studied enough.  The text has more depth of 
   content than the exam will have.  

   Grading status:  Grading has not started yet.  (Professor De 
   Boer is writing letters of recommendation for students 
   applying to graduate school.  When that is done he will start 
   grading.)

                         RESEARCH PAPER   (Last update: 12/14/04)
                         --------------
Assigned on the first day of class, 8/27.  
Part One was due Wednesday, 9/29.  Handed back 10/06.
Part Two due Friday, 12/03.  (On Monday 10/15 via a classroom 
discussion we delayed the due date from 11/22 to the date shown.)

Write a paper about a person who contributed to the development 
of electrical theory.  The paper must explain what motivated the 
person to do the work done or how the person's work influenced
culture.  Some biographic exposition will be necessary, but the 
paper should not be complete biography.  It should focus on one 
limited thesis.  (<A HREF="220/220F99TH.DOC">examples</A>, from bad to good)

Graded in two parts:  One-third of the grade will be from a 
preliminary draft which includes the thesis, outline, and an 
annotated bibliography.  

PART ONE
--------
Do a literature search.  Based on the literature search, write a 
thesis statement and outline.  Turn this part of the assignment 
in when you are done.  (Any time before the due date.) 

Document your sources of support for your thesis statement with 
an annotated bibliography of the relevant literature that you 
found.  For each source, describe the essence of the content and 
how you will use it in your paper.  (E.g.  "The author believes 
that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not done its 
job properly.  This supports point A1 in my outline.") 

Your annotated bibliography must include at least two sources 
which are books published by well known publishers (McGraw-Hill, 
Wiley, etc.) or peer-reviewed sources.  There must be at least 
five sources in total.  Only sources that are independent of each 
other will count toward these totals.  Prof. De Boer has an 
annotated list of recommended sources available on the Web at 
<A 
HREF="../ddb/dordtlit.htm">../ddb/dordtlit.htm</A> 

A common question is, "How many pages long should the paper be?"  
The answer is, "As long as it needs to be."  In other words, 
there is no specific minimum or maximum.  However, you might 
like to keep in mind that students who have done well on this 
paper in previous semesters have turned in papers about 10 pages 
long, double-spaced.  (Five sheets of paper printed on both 
sides.) 

The paper should be in IEEE format.


Grading:

Your thesis with outline and annotated bibliography will be
graded as follows:

"A" Thesis statement has a limited and manageable scope.  It 
    is no more than three sentences and no more than 100 
    words.  It also expresses a specific and legitimately 
    debatable point-of-view.  The paper will either defend 
    that point-of-view or present an analysis of the point-of-
    view, describing the conditions under which it is likely 
    to succeed best and the opposing points-of-view. 

    Your thesis statement must meet the guidelines found in
    either The College Writer or Write for College.  In The 
    College Writer see pages 41, 446ff, 450.  Equivalently, in 
    Write for College, see 024, 111, 113, 287, and 288. 

    The thesis is grammatically correct.

    The outline clearly supports the thesis.  
    
    The bibliography contains at least two good books or peer-
    reviewed sources and at least five sources over-all.  At 
    least two peer-reviewed sources and five sources over-all are 
    independent of each other.  (Examples of non-independent 
    sources are two sources by the same author.) 

    The annotations for each source show clearly the essential
    content of the source that is relevant to your paper and how
    you will use the source.

"B" The bibliography requirements are met.  One or a few other 
    requirements are not met in full. 

"C" No more than one of these problems:  Serious problems with 
    the thesis, although a good-faith effort shows. --OR-- 
    inadequate bibliography --OR-- A good-faith effort on the 
    outline is not evident. 

"D" (This grade will not be given.)

"F" Anything less than a "C"

(Evidence for "Good faith" effort includes the logical 
    relationships between elements of the outline, showing 
    thought and consideration of the subject and supporting the 
    thesis.) 

SECOND PART
Write the final copy of the paper.  The final copy of the paper 
must follow the thesis of the first part of the work.  If you 
discover that the thesis is unworkable, you may resubmit the 
first part for a new first-part grade based on a new thesis, but 
the second part will be docked a fraction of a grade (e.g. a B- 
becomes a C+) each time you submit a new thesis.
