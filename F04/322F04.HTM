|  |       |       |       | Hint for 4.90:  There is enough    |
|  |       |       |       | information given to compute the   |
|  |       |       |       | overdrive voltage.  From this you  |
|  |       |       |       | can determine the region of        |
|  |       |       |       | operation even though you do not   |
|  |       |       |       | know the threshold voltage.        |

|  |       |       |       | sketch with no numbers on the axis |
|  |       |       |       | but with critical points labeled   |
|  |       |       |       | is desired.  The main part of the  |
|  |       |       |       | problem is the proof ("Show. . .") |
|  |       |       |       | and the sketch is intended to      |
|  |       |       |       | illustrate the proof.              |

Note 1) If a "#" follows the "returned" date, then the solution
key is posted on the cork board across the hall from room S233.

Note 2) Problems sets shown above with no "assigned" date are 
tentative.  More problems might be added, expected due dates 
might change, but problems shown will eventually be assigned.

Note 3) A "+" mark in front of the problem number means an answer 
is in the text, in Appendix H.

Note 4) Asterisks (*) indicate more difficult or more time-
consuming problems.  The more asterisks, the more difficult.

Note 5) The letter "D" in front of a problem number indicates a 
design oriented problem.  The student may need to use some 
judgment in understanding what the problem statement is 
requesting.  (Ask Prof. De Boer if you are in doubt.)

                              TESTS       (Last update: 12/08/04)
                              -----
Test #1, Wednesday, 9/29, The test covered Chapters 1 and 2 and 
   Sections 3.1 and 3.2 in Chapter 3, except section 1.7 (Digital 
   Logic Inverters) was be omitted.  Review of labs 1 through 3 
   was advised since these labs reinforce material presented in 
   the text.  One crib sheet (8.5 x 11 inches), both sides, was 
   allowed. Closed book.  A calculator was required.  Grading is 
   in progress.  Average raw score was 74 out of 100.  Minimum 
   raw score for each grade was:  A = 91, A- = 85, B+ = 77, 
   B = 71, B- = 67, C+ = 63, C = 58, C- = 52, D+ = 46, D = 41, 
   D- = 36, F = 0.                

Test #2, Wednesday 11/10.  

   Type: closed book, two crib sheets allowed.  A calculator is 
   needed.  
   
   Coverage:  Chapter 3 Section 3.3 through Chapter 4 Section 
   4.6.  The subjects in the labs and in the lab project may also 
   be covered, however there will be no questions that require 
   knowledge of the SPICE language or the PSPICE or ORCAD 
   programs.  There also will be no questions on diode device 
   physics.  This means specifically that section 3.7 will be 
   omitted from the test.  Material on test #1 is prerequisite 
   for this test.
    
   Results:  Handed back on Friday, 11/12.  Avg raw score was 72 
   out of 100.  Minimum raw score for each grade was:  A = 87, 
   A- = 81, B+ = 74, B = 70, B- = 66, C+ = 61, C = 56, C- = 50, 
   D+ = 45, D = 40, D- = 35, F = 0. 

Final Exam, Saturday 12/11 from 3:30 to 5:30 pm.  
   
   Type: closed book, three crib sheets allowed.  A calculator is 
   needed.
   
   Coverage:  The entire course with emphasis on each topic roughly 
   proportional to the time spent on the topic.  Material covered 
   on the final exam is everything covered in the lists above for 
   Tests #1 and #2 plus all the lab handouts and homework 
   assignments, plus Chapter 4 through Section 10.  There will be 
   no questions on the final exam that require knowledge of the 
   SPICE language or the PSPICE or ORCAD programs.  There also 
   will be no questions on diode device physics (section 3.7).

   Grading Status:  Grading has not started yet.

| 5|  9/29 | 11/19 |       | Design of an unregulated DC power  |
|  |       |       |       | supply.  Three design objectives:  |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | 1.)  Get the maximum DC power from |
|  |       |       |       | a given transformer.               |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | 2.)  Ripple less than 0.25 V p-p   |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | 3.)  A SPICE model of the          |
|  |       |       |       | transformer, the model to be used  |
|  |       |       |       | in simulations which correlate to  |
|  |       |       |       | the performance of your designed   |
|  |       |       |       | DC power supply.                   |

|  |       |       |       | required.  Due date not yet        |
|  |       |       |       | established, probably late October.|

|  |       |       |       | Three weeks have been planned for  |
|  |       |       |       | this lab, 9/29, 10/6, 10/13.       |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | This lab was extended two more     |
|  |       |       |       | weeks, 10/20, 10/27.               |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Grading status:  Grading is in     |
|  |       |       |       | progress.                          |

| 7| 11/10 |  ---  |  ---  | MOSFET Single-Stage CS Amplifier   |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Use a TN0606 MOSFET to create a    |
|  |       |       |       | CS amplifier to drive a 1 Kohm     |
|  |       |       |       | load.  The 1 Kohm load and the     |
|  |       |       |       | input signal must be capacitively  |
|  |       |       |       | coupled.  Design goals listed from |
|  |       |       |       | highest priority to lowest are:    |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | 1.) Maximum output amplitude       |
|  |       |       |       | 2.) Freq. response 20 Hz - 20 kHz  |
|  |       |       |       | 3.) Minimum distortion.            |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | You should build a laboratory      |
|  |       |       |       | prototype and do suitable tests    |
|  |       |       |       | on it.  SPICE (PSpice) can be      |
|  |       |       |       | useful as well, especially to      |
|  |       |       |       | verify initial design calculations.|
