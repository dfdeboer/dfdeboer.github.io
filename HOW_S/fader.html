<h1>Fader</h1><p>

A <i>fader</i> might also be known as a "potentiometer," or a "pot," or a "slider," or a "slide-pot," 
or a "send," or a "sender."  The term seen most often in literature seems to be "fader."  </p><p>

A fader is any device used to control the amount of signal coupled from a channel or 
bus to another bus.  The signal may be mono, stereo or multi-channel.  By moving one 
control the amount of the signal that is coupled is smoothly varied from nothing to a 
strong amount. </p><p>

(If the control is used to blend from one sound to another sound via only one motion 
of the control&mdash;if there are two signal sources, one destination, and one 
control&mdash;this is called a <i>crossfader</i>.  Most mixers that are specialized for 
disk-jockey or DJ use will feature at least one crossfader to allow an easy transition 
from one song to the next by moving only one control knob.  This web page is not about 
crossfaders.  Mixers designed for live-sound reinforcement usually have no crossfaders.
In order to achieve the same effect without a crossfader one needs move one fader up 
while simultaneously moving another fader down.)</p><p> 

Some people associate the word <i>fader</i> with linear slide-potentiometers and the 
word <i>sender</i> with rotary knobs or rotary-potentiometers.  These items are 
electrically identical.  The only difference is the type of motion needed to actuate 
the control.<br><br>

<h1>Logarithmic Taper</h1><p>

Faders (or sends&mdash;from now on they will all be called "faders" in this document) 
are not just ordinary potentiometers.  They have a logarithmic resistive taper so that 
they respond to the electrical signals closer to the way our ears respond to 
sound-pressure levels as compared to a linear resistive taper.  When the fader is in 
or near the lower fifth of its range of motion, due to various technical reasons, 
the taper is not very accurate.  This gives the control a great deal of sensitivity or 
touchiness.  Just a small amount of adjustment to the control seems to make a large 
change in (e.g. seems to double or quadruple) the loudness of the sound.  But very 
desirably, in the top 4/5 of the range of adjustment the loudness of the sound varies 
smoothly and appropriately with the amount of motion the control is given.  If faders 
used in mixer boards were not given this logarithmic taper the top 4/5 of the range of 
motion would do very little.  Almost all the loudness variation would be in the bottom 
fifth of the range of motion.  The logarithmic taper flips this character around and
makes most of the range of the control behave much more as we expect it should.</p><p> 

The down-side of using faders with <i>logarithmic tapers</i> (also known as audio tapers) 
is that the bottom fifth of the fader's range of motion is very difficult to use 
constructively except as a distance to pass through to fade a signal down to zero or 
up from zero.  If you find that the sound is the proper loudness to blend well into 
the mix only when the fader is in the bottom portion of its range you will find 
the mix hard to control.  Tiny adjustments to the faders will make big changes.  
This is symptomatic of a <i>gain structure</i> problem.  That is a story for another 
day.  For now, take at least the first step and scan the board for any blinking read 
"PK" or "peak" LEDs and use the channel's PFL button to check the adjustment of the 
gain-trim knob.  Most of the time if you are mixing with the fader in the bottom 
portion of its range the problem is the gain-trim knob, but there can be other 
ways to mess up the gain-structure.</p><p>

Faders are marked in decibels.  The 0 dB spot is the nominal spot where the sound in the 
channel is neither amplified nor attenuated.  It is just passed over to a bus (or busses).  
If the fader is set above 0 dB then the sound sent to the bus will be that much louder 
than the sound in the channel and vice versa, if the fader is set below 0 dB then the 
sound sent to the bus (or busses) will be softer than the sound in the channel by that 
much.  It is more-or-less an industry standard that faders should provide smooth action 
between +10 dB (all the way up) and -30 dB (about 1/4 of the way up).  You will see these
same decibel markings on practically all professional mix consoles, digital or analog.  
(Our less expensive Alan &amp; Heath GL2400 mixer has only a +6 dB boost available on 
the AUX faders.)  When the fader is all the way down it is said to be set 
at -&infin; dB (minus infinity decibels).</p><p>

On the right side of the illustration above, the AUX faders have a small triangle at 
the <br>3 o'clock position to mark the 0 dB setting.  Settings for these faders that 
provide pleasing mixes typically range from about 9 o'clock to 3 or 4 o'clock.  If 
a setting in this range is not available to make the signal the right loudness in 
the mix, then there possibly is a gain-structure error.</p><P>

On the left side of the illustration above you can notice a heavy line at the 0 dB
setting that extends across all the channels.  Pleasing mix settings can usually 
be found somewhere between the -30 dB setting and about +3 dB.  If you have to go 
outside this range to get a pleasing loudness of the channel in the mix you may 
do so but be on guard for a gain-structure error.</p><p>

In fact, if your gain-structure is well set, usually a pleasing mix will be found 
when the faders are in the &ndash;10 to 0 dB range.</p><br>


<h1>Anticipating the next portion of the worship service</h1><p>

As as worship service transitions from one portion of the service to the next, 
for example from a prayer to a praise-and-worship song, it is proper for 
the sound operator to anticipate which faders need to be pushed up for the next 
event.  Some sound operators do this by pushing these faders up about 1/4 inch 
to make them quick-to-find when the moment for action arrives.  One needs to be 
careful with this strategy.  The faders are touchy in these low ranges and one 
might couple more of the signal into the mix than anticipated.  Especially if the
praise team is picking mics out of stands (to hand-hold them) or doing other 
noisy things in anticipation of the song, way more of these noises can get 
coupled into the final mix than you might have anticipated.</p><p>

As an alternative strategy, some operators cut up refrigerator magnets into 
small strips about 1/2 inch high by the width of a channel-strip.  These can be 
easily moved around during the worship service to mark the next channels or 
groups to become active in the mix.  Most mixer boards feature about an inch 
or two of a flat steel surface below the main faders to accommodate either 
adhesive or magnetic labels.  In any case, it routine to stick various 
labels on this area to assist with rapid recognition of the channels, and 
to remove, add, and edit these labels frequently as desired.</p><p>
