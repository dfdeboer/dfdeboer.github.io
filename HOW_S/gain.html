<h1>Gain Structure</h1><p>

How does one get the loudness correct when there are so many ways to adjust 
loudness?  <i>Gain Structure</i> is the theory behind getting the loudness of 
the signals in the mixer board to optimal levels at all points.  (Gain Structure 
is also known as <i>Gain Staging</i>.)<br><br>

Imagine that the sermon is in progress.  Only one microphone is being used to pick 
up the pastor's voice, the ear-set wireless microphone.  Also imagine that the sound 
operator wants to turn up the volume.  There are a number of ways to do this.  The 
illustration below shows five different ways to change the pastor's volume.  
(The pastor's mike is connected to channel 1, the left-most channel on our mixer.)<br><br>

1.)  The <i>line pad</i> push-button (grey, near the top of the board) will change 
the volume by 20 dB (Louder if you let it up, softer if you press it down.)<br><br>

2.)  The <i>gain trim</i> knob (red, near the top of the board) will change the pastor's 
volume.<br><br>

3.)  The <i>channel fader</i> (black, slider near the bottom of the board) will change the 
pastor's volume.<br><br>

4.)  The <i>LR master faders</i> (the two left-most yellow sliders) will change the pastor's 
volume<br><br>

5.)  The <i>M master fader</i> (the right-most yellow slider) will change the pastor's volume.  
(We use the "M" or "Monitor" output to create the mono mix for the sanctuary's loudspeakers.)<br>

<table align="center" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0" WIDTH="590"><tr><td><p>

But the five items mentioned above are not the only ways to change the pastor's volume.  
On the pastor's wireless bodypack there is a gain switch.  We usually set it to the middle 
position.  This will also change the pastor's volume.<br><p align="center"><br><br>

<i>Above:  The gain switch on the pastor's wireless bodypack.  (We set it a "0")</i></p><p><br><br>

In addition, there is the gain control on the power amplifier which will also change the 
pastor's volume.</p><p align="center">

<img src="./Crown_CDI4000_gain.png"><br>
<i>Above:  Gain control on the power amplifier.</i></p><p><br>

That brings the total to seven different ways to change the pastor's volume.  Of course, in 
routine operation we somehow intuitively <i>just know</i> that the channel fader (black slider)
is the item to adjust.  We have always done it that way, so it seems obvious.  <i>Gain Structure</i>
is the explanation for why the adjustment should be done this way in routine operation.  More 
specifically, <i>gain structure explains how to set all the other possible adjustments correctly
so that the channel fader (black slider) does what we expect.</i></p><br>


<h1>Description of gain structure</h1><p>

The <i>signal chain</i> is the sequence of circuits and adjustments that the signal passes through 
on the way to the loudspeaker, recording, video stream, or any other final destination.  At every 
point along the way of the signal chain the signal must be at an acceptable level, not too strong 
and not too weak.<br><br>

&bull; If the signal is <font color="red">too strong</font>, it becomes <font color="red">distorted</font> at that point.  No gain adjustment 
after that point can remove the distortion.  Furthermore, no gain adjustment before this point 
can eliminate the distortion without adding needless noise.  There is only one gain adjustment 
that will correctly mitigate the problem of the signal being too strong at this point.<br><br>

&bull; If the signal is <font color="blue">too weak</font> at some point, it cannot overpower background <font color="blue">noise, hiss, 
buzzes and/or humming</font> sounds that exist at extremely low levels in any electronic circuit. 
(Even in digital circuits quantization noise becomes an issue.)  Once this noise is apparent 
in the signal, no gain adjustment after this point can eliminate the noise.  Furthermore, no 
gain adjustment before this point can solve the noise problem without adding needless 
distortion.  There is only one gain adjustment that will correctly mitigate the problem of 
the signal being too weak at this point.<br><br> 

Getting the signal strength within bounds all along the signal chain starts at the very first 
gain adjustment.  In the case of the pastor's mic example above, that is the gain switch on the 
pastor's bodypack.  If that is set too high (e.g. in our case, "mic") then there will be distortion in the 
radio-signal.  No gain adjustment later in the signal chain can remove that distortion.  If it 
is set too low ("&ndash;10" in our case) then the signal will be too weak in the radio channel 
and some hissing and static will be audible in the signal.  No gain adjustment later in the 
signal chain can remove the noise.<br><br>

That first gain adjustment in the signal chain, wherever it may be, is critical.  It matches the 
source.  In this example, the combination of the particular brand and model of the pastor's 
ear-set microphone and the pastor's style of talking (or shouting or whispering) is matched 
to the electronics that will follow the gain adjustment.  Usually, once this one is somewhat 
near optimal the rest of the gain adjustments will be about right too just because previous 
users of the system have set them reasonably.  But any gain adjustment that runs the signal 
level below the noise level or above the distortion level will cause a problem that cannot 
be corrected well by any other gain control.<br><br>

The last gain adjustment in the signal chain has a special role.  Instead of adapting the signal 
level to the following electronics, it adapts the signal level to the hearing levels of the people in 
the room!  In the example of the pastor's mic channel, the last gain control in the signal chain 
is the one on the power amplifier.  This is the gain control that establishes the maximum loudness 
in the sanctuary (or other destination) that can be achieved.  If this is too low, no amount of 
adding gain before it will add enough loudness.  Those earlier gain controls will only end up 
adding distortion.  If this final gain control is too high, there will be hiss and noise in the 
background of the sound.  No gain control in the signal chain before the final one will do a good 
job of reducing that background noise.  If this gain control is set correctly there will be 
enough loudness to bring on feedback in practically any situation (if the faders are pushed up 
too high for example) and to cause the audience to perceive more than enough loudness, yet the 
signal will be undistorted during normal operations and when there is supposed to be silence, 
the system will not be humming or hissing or letting spurious radio signals get through.  <br><br>

Once all the channels are correctly gain trimmed the rest of the board will generally behave
well in terms of overall signal levels.  The general strategy should be to use the master and 
group faders (red and yellow sliders) to control the desired overall loudness of the 
mix and to use the channel faders (black) to get a pleasing balance within the mix. In many 
cases one can put the group master faders (red) to good creative use in managing the 
instruments vs. vocal balance and the L-R master faders (two left-most yellow) to control 
overall loudness.  As one is doing this one should be careful not to over-drive or under-drive 
the internal mixer busses leading into and out of the master section of the mixer board, but as 
I've mentioned, if the individual channels are all properly gain-trimmed and the final power-amplifier
is properly gain trimmed, then everything in-between will tend to stay in-bounds for any 
reasonable mix.</p><br> 

<h1>How to get the gain structure right</h1><p>

Each gain adjustment along the signal chain will have some type of indicator of signal level.  
In general, <font color="red">if a red light is blinking, the signal is too strong, reduce the associated 
gain setting.</font>  <font color="green">If green lights are never blinking, the gain is too low, increase the associated
gain control.</font>  One should read the <i>user's manual</i> for the equipment to discover how to 
deal with yellow indicators.  These vary from device-to-device.  In general, on 
analog equipment <font color="#CC9900">occasional blinking of yellow is usually considered acceptable</font> but does 
mean that some inaudible or nearly inaudible distortion has happened.  The rules above apply to all 
the equipment on our sound desk except the CD recorder and the Behringer audio interface to the 
Facebook stream because those two items have digital aspects.   
<br><br>

A side note:  Alan &amp; Heath recommends that optimal levels for our mixer ideally should be 
high enough to make the +6 dB (yellow) LED blink occasionally on the loudest parts of the signal.  
At Covenant Church we run a little lower than that (keep peaks at 0 dB or less if practical) 
because some of our equipment is digital, such as the CD recorder and the Behringer computer 
audio interface for the Facebook stream.<br><br>

Digital equipment takes various approaches to color-coding signal levels.  As usual, green is good,
red is bad, but yellow is different.  Some digital equipment does not use yellow on the VU meters. 
This is because the boundary between bad distortion and a practically perfect signal is very narrow 
on all digital systems.  The signal either clips (indicated by red) or is near perfect (indicated by 
green or any color other than red).  For some other digital equipment the yellow lights indicate a 
desirable level for the loudest portions of the program.  In this case the loudest parts of the 
signal should routinely and frequently cause yellow to be displayed.  In still other digital 
equipment the yellow represents a reserve headroom amount that should not be routinely used.  
In this case an occasional flash of yellow is OK, but one does not want to see it routinely, not 
even on the loudest parts of the program.  Read the equipment manual(s) to figure out the 
recommended settings.</p><br>

<h1>Behringer computer audio interface and CD player</h1><p>
Our entire sound system is analog except for the CD recorder and the Behringer computer audio 
interface that delivers audio for the Facebook stream.  On the CD recorder we desire to see the 
loudest parts of the signal at &ndash;12 to &ndash;3 dB but not routinely above &ndash;3 dB.  (The CD recorder has
no yellow colors on its meters.)  On the Behringer computer audio interface the "peak" LEDs (red) 
and the gain adjustments on this audio interface are on the analog side and should be adjusted 
according to the analog rules above, but it is a little difficult because there are no green
or yellow LEDs, just one red led on each channel to warn of clipping.  The red should never blink, 
but the gain should be high enough so that they are on the verge of blinking.  (If it blinks 
rarely, leave it alone until a practice session later.  It is a touchy adjustment and it is 
easy to make it worse.)  The OBS software that receives the USB audio stream uses the convention that
the louder portions of the signal should drive the VU meter into the yellow.  Yellow is the goal to
achieve, but red is to be avoided.</p><br>


<h1>Shure SLX wireless mic--pastor's mic</h1><p>

In the example of the pastor's microphone, the indicator for the bodypack's gain switch is on
the receiver.  On the left-hand side of the receiver there is a small LED bar-graph style VU 
meter.  If the green lights on this meter never flash, the gain is too low, switch the gain 
on the bodypack to a higher setting.  If the yellow light on this meter are frequently
blinking or if the red light is occasionally blinking, switch to a lower gain setting on the bodypack.
</p><p align="center">

<img src="./Shure_SLX1_bodypack_gain_3.png"><br>
<i>Above:  Each gain adjustment has some type of indicator to help set it correctly.</i></p><br>


<h1>Shure LX wireless mics&mdash;handheld wireless mics</h1><p>
Our handheld wireless microphones also have gain trim adjustments in them.  The VU meter that 
responds to the gain trim in the microphone is the "AUDIO" VU meter on the corresponding 
receiver.</p><p align="center">

<img width="580" src="./Shure_LX2_gain_pot.png"><br>
<img width="580" src="./Shure_LX4_receiver_VU.png"<br>
<i>Above:  Each gain adjustment has some type of indicator to help set it correctly.</i><p><br>

Many wireless receivers have additional gain adjustments on the receiver itself.  One can be
seen on the front panel of the "LX receiver" shown above, labeled "LEVEL."  In our case, Turn 
this front-panel level control all the way up.  Then adjust the corresponding gain trim at the 
top of the mixer board (red) as usual.  Shure provides this front-panel LEVEL control just in 
case the device the receiver is connected to does not have a gain trim adjustment.  The only 
reason to set the LEVEL control on the front panel of the receiver below maximum is if you 
cannot prevent overloading (red LED flashing or audible distortion) any other way.</p><br>

<h1>Electro-acoustic musical instruments</h1><p>

Some electro-acoustic musical instruments have gain controls on them.  Musicians may use 
these for creative control.  However if you are having difficulty getting enough signal at 
the first gain trim of the sound board (see next paragraph), an adjustment on the musical 
instrument is the likely problem.  Most instruments cannot produce such a strong signal 
that it necessarily overloads a mixer board, but weak signals can be an issue.  With this 
in mind, <u>if possible, ask the musician to turn the gain control on the instrument all 
the way up</u>, or at least all the way up for the parts that the musician wants to be the 
loudest.  Guitars are not the only electro-acoustic instruments that might have
gain controls.  Violins, saxophones, and many acoustic instruments equipped with a pickup, can 
have gain controls.</p><p align="center">

<h1>Electric musical instruments</h1><p>

Most electric musical instruments have several gain controls.  Musicians often deliberately 
cause distortion with these gain controls as a creative effect.  Just be sure the signal 
arriving at the mixer boards is at a normal level.  Quite often the electric instrument
drives an "amplifier" located on-stage near the performer (really an amplifier plus a loudspeaker) 
and a microphone is placed in front of the amplifier's loudspeaker to get the signal to the 
sound system.  If this is the case, the gain structure issues are all the normal issues that 
relate to the type of microphone being used.<br><br>

Sometimes an electric instrument (electric guitar, electric violin, etc.) is connected to the 
sound system via a <i>direct input box</i> (DI box).  In this case, if the signal at the mixer board 
is too weak, ask the musician to turn up the last gain control in the chain of controls that they 
have.  If this control is already all the way up, ask them to turn up the next gain control back 
in the chain, etc. until you have enough signal.<br><br>

Some musical instruments, especially keyboards, have stereo direct outputs.  (Labeled <i>right</i>
and <i>left</i>)  If you want a monoaural signal, connect to only the <i>left</i> output.  If 
the <i>right</i> output sockets are all empty, it is an industry convention that the <i>left</i> 
outputs shall be automatically mixed down to mono.  As soon as something is plugged into any 
<i>right</i> output then all the outputs become dedicated to their labeled channels.  If you 
plug into only a <i>right</i> output you get only half the signal, whereas if you plug into only
a </i>left</i> output you get the sum of the left and right outputs.</p><p align="center">

<h1>Alan &amp; Heath mixer&mdash;line pad</h1><p>

Following the signal chain from the pastor's microphone, through the pastor's bodypack and the 
associated receiver, the signal then enters the Allan &amp; Heath mixer.  Once inside the mixer
the signal passes through the <i>line pad</i> attenuator which is controlled by a small white 
pushbutton at the top of the mixer board.  If this switch is down, then the signal is attenuated 
(weakened) by 20 dB.  (That's quite a lot.)  The general rule is that these buttons should be down 
(line pad should be in use) unless the gain trim adjustment (discussed next) cannot be done 
correctly with the button down.  The first amplifier in the mixer needs to be very sensitive 
in order to handle the weakest microphone signals.  That means that this first amplifier can 
clip (distort) rather easily.  With the line pad switch the mixer channel can be adapted to 
any type of signal from the weakest microphone (signals of just a few hundredths of a volt) 
to headphone-jack level signals from consumer electronics such as a smartphone (a signal of 
about a volt or two.) and everything in-between.</p><br>


<h1>Alan &amp; Heath mixer&mdash;gain trim (red)</h1><p>

After the line pad, the signal goes through the gain trim adjustment, a red knob labeled "GAIN" 
near the top of the mixer board.  This is used to match the signal level closely to the 
characteristic of the channel's first amplifier.  To monitor the signal level at this point, 
watch the mini-VU meter just above the black fader (slider) for that channel.  You want to 
see as much green as possible but rarely or never yellow and certainly never red.  If the 
line-pad button is down and the gain trim is fully clockwise without getting enough signal 
to activate two green LEDs on the mini-VU then it is necessary to let the line-pad button 
up (take the line pad out of the circuit and give up its headroom).  Now it will be possible 
to correctly set the gain trim.  <br><br>

Each channel of the mixer should be checked for gain-trim before each event.  This is because 
vocalists and microphone setups vary.  If you presume that last week's settings will be OK, 
you will probably run into a situation sooner or later where the board is just hard to manage.  
A hard-to-manage board might be one that seems to want to break out in feedback with every little
twiddle or one that just will not produce enough loudness in one or more channels while other channels 
are blasting through.  A well-gain-trimmed board will usually produce a pleasing mix when most
faders (black sliders) are between 1/2 and 2/3 of the way up.  In this range the faders will have 
a good feel.  That is, moving the faders will produce the expected proportional amounts of change 
in the sound, not sudden unexpected changes. </p><br>

<h1>Alan &amp; Heath mixer&mdash;using the stereo VU meter</h1><p>
There is a stereo VU meter in the master section of the mixer.  This meter can be used along 
with the pre-fade listener (PFL) and after-fader listener (AFL) buttons to monitor signal 
levels at various points in the mixer board.  It has higher resolution than the mini-VU meters 
built into each channel, so it is well worth learning how to use it.  This stereo VU meter works
in conjunction with the headphone buss.  The headphone jack near the VU meter sends the signal 
from the VU meter to your ears.</p></td></tr></table>

<i>Above:  Stereo VU meter and headphone controls in the master section</i><br><br><br>

To use the stereo VU meter and headphones to good advantage, first make sure that all the 
pre-fader listener (PFL) and after-fader listener (AFL) buttons are up.  These PFL and AFL 
buttons are near every fader and near every master "send" in the master section.  On the 
Alan &amp; Heath GL2400 mixer if a button is round (not square or rectangular) it is a PFL 
or AFL button.  All these round buttons need to be up to start with.  All their associated 
yellow LEDs must be extinguished.  Additionally, just below the main VU meters in the master 
section of the mixer board there is a red LED labeled PFL/AFL.  This LED must be extinguished 
also.  If it is illuminated, there is a PFL and/or AFL button down and a yellow PFL or AFL 
indicator still illuminated somewhere.<br><br>

Now press the single PFL button for the channel you want to gain trim.  The yellow LED
near the PFL button should light and the red PFL/AFL LED under the main VU meters should light. 
The stereo VU meter is now monitoring that channel's gain trim, and that channel only.  Adjust
the gain trim and if necessary, the line-pad switch, for maximum green with no yellow or a 
rare yellow flicker.  While you are doing this, you will be able to hear that channel, and 
that channel only, in the headphones.  Perhaps the headphones are too loud or soft for 
your taste when the gain trim is adjusted correctly according to the stereo VU meter.  The 
headphone MONITOR knob (red) below the stereo VU meter is just for you.  Adjust that to your taste.  
It has no effect on the signal strength anywhere in the mixer board, except for the amount 
of signal that is sent from the stereo VU meter to your headphones.  <br><br>

After you have gain-trimmed a channel using the stereo VU meter, let that channel's PFL button 
up again and observe that the PFL/AFL red LED is extinguished again.  The stereo VU meter 
and the headphones now default to monitoring either the L-R buss or the recording mix 
(also known as the 2TRK mix), as selected by the small white button just below the headphone 
MONITOR knob.  In our situation the need to monitor the L-R mix in the headphones is rare 
because the overall sound balance is in the sanctuary can be much better evaluated by 
listening to the room without headphones.  Why use technology when there is a more perfect 
way to monitor that sound!  Thus, for all practical purposes the white square button below 
the headphone MONITOR knob should always be down so that the headphones and the stereo VU 
meter monitor the recording (2TRK) mix by default.</p><br>


<h1>Alan &amp; Heath&mdash;Creating the L-R mix</h1><p>

Once all the channels are properly gain trimmed (red knobs at the top of the mixer board) 
then most of the rest of the gain structure falls into place much more easily.  Furthermore,
most mixer boards are desinged with extra gain margins on the intermediate points in the 
mixer board, so even if there is a minor gain structure error in the middle of the chain 
it will create little or no distortion or hiss or hum.  The discussion that follows assumes
that each channel is properly gain-trimmed.<br><br>

For the moment, assume that no groups are being used.  For each channel that has a signal 
that should be present in the main mix (sent everywhere--sanctuary, fellowship hall, 
nursery, Facebook stream, recording&mdash;everywhere) press down the white "LR" button 
near the associated channel fader (black slider).  Then push the fader up to near the 
0 dB line.  In the example of the pastor's sermon, there is only one microphone that has 
a significant amount of signal, the pastor's microphone.  For a  properly gain-trimmed 
channel, 0 dB represents a nominal mix, so usually you will find that a pleasing mix will 
be found with the faders near 0 dB, plus or minus a bit to suit your judgement.<br><br>

The gain structure issue now is to be sure the L-R busses have nominal levels of signal 
on them.  Above the L fader (left-most yellow slider) you will find an AFL button.  Press 
it down and look at the stereo VU meter.  It should be bouncing up to at least &ndash;12 
and no higher than 0 dB.  (Be sure no other PFL or AFL buttons are down.  The meter is 
only accurate when exactly one PFL or AFL is in use.)  Good gain structure on the LR 
busses will almost automatically happen if the channel gain trims are correct, so it is 
not urgent to keep monitoring this.  But if you suspect a problem, this is one place to 
check.  Check each of the L and the R channels individually and one-at-a-time.  If signal 
levels are too high, pull down about the same amount on <i>all</i> the channel faders 
(black), and push up if the signal is too low.  <br><br>

You will probably notice that as more and more channels are opened up with significant 
signals on them, the lower the channel faders (black) need to be to get the best mix.
For example, in a praise and worship team situation you might have four vocalists with 
microphones, a guitar, a piano with two microphones on it, a cello, and a flute, all with
mics.  Now if each of these are properly gain trimmed and if each channel is coupled to 
the LR busses, and if each channel fader is set at 0 dB, there will be much more than 
0 dB, maybe +9 dB or so on the LR busses because of the multiplicity of signals flowing 
onto those LR busses.  Just like a river with many tributaries gets wide, the LR busses
with many signals flowing into them can get overloaded.  But if you just pull back all 
the channel faders (black) to a little below 0 dB, the sum of all their signals will end 
up being close to 0 dB on the LR busses.  Fortunately, our Alan &amp; Heath mixer has 
lots of headroom (+16 dB according to the user's manual), so gain structure errors do 
not become very noticeable on these mix busses, but the principle remains valid for 
getting the best possible results.</p><br>

<h1>Alan &amp; Heath&mdash;Creating group mixes.</h1><p>

If you elect to use groups, couple the signals to the 1-2 or 3-4 groups using the small 
grey buttons near the channel faders.  Usually only one (or zero) of these three buttons 
should be down for each channel.  (In our context, pressing two or more of these on one
channel will probably create complications in balancing out the mix.)  The group busses 
can be checked for proper signal levels just like the L-R busses.  Press down one of the 
AFL buttons above a group fader (red slider) to check that signal.  Similarly, if 
corrective action is needed, all the channel faders feeding that group need to be adjusted 
in unison.</p><br>

<h1>Alan &amp; Heath&mdash;master outputs.</h1><p>

<i>Sanctuary mix master</i><br>
After the main mix is created on the LR busses we route that to various places using 
outputs from the master (middle) section of the mixer board.  The Sanctuary mix is 
derived by mixing the LR busses equally into one monaural mix.  This output is controlled
by the "M" fader (yellow) in the master section.  <u>Normally this should be set at 0 dB</u>, 
but if you want to make it louder or softer in the sanctuary, this is overall "program 
volume control" for that purpose.  Why might you want to do this?  Maybe the sound system
is being used for an event that is happening exclusively in the fellowship hall.  Then 
by sliding this "M" fader all the way down the hollow echoey distant sound of the sanctuary 
speakers will not bleed into the fellowship hall.  You can monitor this gain structure 
of this output using the AFL button just above the "M" fader.<br><br>

<i>Fellowship hall mix master</i><br>
Another master output is from the bottom of the "matrix" section in the top left area
of the mixer.  The "MTX1" fader (red knob) provides this output.  Normally we set this at 
<br><u>0 dB (3 o'clock)</u>, but if you want to adjust the loudness in the fellowship hall only, this is the
"program volume level" knob for that.<br><br>

<i>Basement mix master</i><br>
Another master output is from the bottom of the "matrix" section in the top left area 
of the mixer.  The "MTX2" fader (red knob) provides this output.  We have speakers in 
the nursery, the basement hallway area outside the nursery, and the youth room.  The 
"MTX2" master is the "program volume level" knob for these speakers. Normally we set this
at <u>0 dB (3 o'clock)</u><br><br> 

<i>Stereo recording mix masters</i><br>
Finally in the master section, "MTX3" (left) and "MTX4" (right) provide a stereo output
for the CD recorder and for the Facebook stream and the hearing loop system.  This stereo 
output goes to the RANE (brand) distribution amplifier where there are a number of additional 
gain settings and outputs.  The RANE distribution amplifier is set up such that if you send
it a signal that is properly gain structured, all the signals within the RANE unit will also
be properly gain structured as well as all the signals delivered from that unit to other 
devices such as the CD recorder, Facebook stream, and the hearing loop.  The "MTX3" or 
"MTX4" master outputs can be checked for gain structure by pressing an AFL button near 
the "MTX3" or "MTX4" master knobs (red).  Then the stereo VU meter will show the level at 
this output and the headphones will allow you to listen to this signal.  Normally we set 
these "MTX3" and "MTX4" masters at <u>0 dB (3 o'clock)</u>.<br><br>

One pair of outputs from the RANE distribution amplifier, containing the final stereo recording mix, 
is routed back to the Alan &amp; Heath mixer via the "2TRK" input to the mixer.  This 
allows the final recording mix to be the default monitoring heard in the headphones and 
it also allows the Alan &amp; Heath's stereo VU meter to monitor the final gain structure 
of the stereo recording mix at the outputs of the RANE distribution amplifier.<br><br> 

If any of these master outputs are showing signals that are too strong or two weak it is 
quite unlikely that these masters are the best places to make the adjustment.  The most 
likely culprits are channel gain trims that have not been carefully set and/or inappropriate 
levels on the LR busses due to a mix that is overall to strong or too weak.</p><br>


<h1>A bit off-topic:  Gain structure of the recording mix</h1><p>

For a variety of reasons, if all channels have been properly gain-trimmed and a reasonable  
mix is in progress, the VU levels of the recording mix (2TRK) will take care of themselves 
and land in &ndash;3 to &ndash;12 dB range rather naturally.  Thus, monitoring the VU levels 
of the recording mix is not a priority.  However, listening in the headphones to the 
recording mix is a good thing to do periodically.  The recording mix normally will track 
the sanctuary mix, but the AUX 5 and AUX 6 sends may be used to add additional signal to 
the recording mix.<br><br>

Normally the AUX 5 and AUX 6 sends (Yellow knobs that are above brown knobs) should be off 
(fully counterclockwise).  There are two exceptions.<br><br> 

<i>Exception 1.)  Spoken word, AUX 5 &amp; AUX 6 each to 2 o'clock</i><br>
If a channel has a spoken-word signal on it, then turn each of those AUX 5 and AUX 6 
sends to the 2 o'clock position to couple an <i>extra</i> amount of that signal into 
the recording mix.  This is done to bring the spoken-word part of the worship service 
to the same overall loudness as the praise-and-worship parts of the service.  Musical 
vocal parts and instruments like guitars that are being amplified should not have extra 
signal coupled into the recording mix.  They are going to be plenty loud in the 
recording mix because they will be strongly present in the L-R mix.<br><br>  

<i>Exception 2.)  Miking of a musical source for the recording only</i><br>
It is also possible to couple a signal only into the recording mix.  We usually do this 
with the piano, choir, and the ambience channels (channels 23 and 24 are the ambience 
channels) and we do it in stereo.  In this case leave the L-R, 1-2, and 3-4 buss coupler 
buttons near the associated fader up.  The signal now cannot get into the L-R main mix 
nor will it be reproduced in the sanctuary loudspeakers.  But by adding an <i>extra</i> 
amount of it to the recording mix via the AUX 5 and AUX 6 sends (yellow knobs) these 
signals can still be mixed into the recording mix via the channel faders.  Very often 
we use two microphones for these types of signals and mix them in stereo.  Then the 
right microphone should have the AUX 5 send set to the 3 o'clock setting and the AUX 6 
send set to full counterclockwise, coupling that signal only into the right channel 
of the recording mix.  Similarly, the channel with the left microphone should have 
the AUX 5 send fully counterclockwise and the AUX 6 fader at 3 o'clock.  (If only 
one microphone is used set all three coupler buttons up as for stereo but set the 
associated AUX 5 and AUX 6 sends each to 2 o'clock.)</p><p><br>
