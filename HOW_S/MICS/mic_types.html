<h1>Types of Microphones</h1><p>

On this page there is a section on vocabulary that describes and defines the parts 
of a microphone.  Having a clear vocabulary helps explain how one microphone differs 
from another, and that in turn helps one understand at a fundamental level which 
microphone might work better than another in a particular situation.  Following 
that are three qualities of a microphone that represent a tradeoff.  These are the 
degree of audio fidelity, the degree of directionality, and the degree of miniaturization.  
Generally, you can optimize one of those qualities, but at the the expense of the 
others.  Finally, there is a discussion of the underlying technology of the 
microphone.  There are four technologies that one might encounter in house-of-worship 
applications.  They are the dynamic, the condenser, the ribbon microphone, and the 
piezoelectric or crystal technology.<br><br>

This discussion of microphones is written with house-of-worship applications in 
mind.  There are many other discussions of types of microphones that have greater 
generality.  Wikipedia's article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone"
>microphones</a> is one example.</p><br>

  
<h1>Vocabulary</h1><p>

<i>Capsule</i><br>
All microphones depend on some sort of analog 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer">transducer</a> that converts 
the acoustic energy of sound waves into an electrical signal. More often in the 
professional audio industry the transducer is called a <i>capsule</i>.  But it may 
sometimes be called a <i>cap</i> or a <i>cartridge</i> or a <i>microphone element</i>. 
It will usually be called a <i>capsule</i> for these web pages. The capsule needs 
to be mechanically protected so that the microphone can be handled without damaging 
the capsule, and so that the capsule can be properly exposed to sound but screened 
from wind and handling noise.  This page is all about these capsules and the mechanical 
housing and associated parts around the capsule.<br><br>

Some capsules create more powerful electrical signals than others. Some capsules 
create signals strong enough to directly pass through hundreds of feet of microphone 
wire before they need any amplification. The most powerful capsules create so-called 
<i>microphone-level</i> signals. These are voltage signals of about &ndash;40&nbsp;dBV 
down to about &ndash;60&nbsp;dBV.  (About 1 to 10&nbsp;mV peak)  That's not really very 
strong!  Other capsules create even weaker signals.  They require a pre-amplifier to 
be located adjacent to the capsule (inside the microphone) or within a few feet of 
the capsule, say in a bodypack.  There a pre-amplifier strengthens the signal to an 
optimal level for sending down a cable or for wireless transmission.  The pre-amplifier 
in or near the microphone creates a so-called "line-level" signal that is even stronger 
than a microphone-level signal.  Line-level signals are in the range of about +1.8&nbsp;dBV 
down to about &ndash;10&nbsp;dBV, with 0&nbsp;dBV as nominal.  (1228 mV down to 316 mV peak
with 1000 mV as nominal)<br><br>

It is a little ironic that by the time the signal gets to the mixer board, the capsules 
that generate the strongest signals ("mic level") provide the board with the weakest 
signals ("mic level") due the absence of a pre-amplifier ahead of the mixer board.  
But there is a minor advantage in the absence of a preamplifier.  Each amplifier or 
preamplifier in the pathway of the signal needs to be properly <a href=../gain.html>gain 
structured</a>.  Improper gain structure causes noise or distortion.  Capsules that 
require no preamplification&mdash;mic-level capsules&mdash;avoid a potential gain 
structure problem.  Sometimes mic level capsules are preferred solely for this advantage.<br><br>

Capsules that require a pre-amplifier must be properly gain structured.  Some preamplifiers
have a switch or knob that can be adjusted to adapt the pre-amplifier to the audio loudness 
the capsule is exposed to.  Since gain structure is even more critical if a wireless 
channel is employed, almost all wireless microphones have gain trim adjustments, which 
may be hidden behind a battery door or deep on a menu.  Most capsules that require a 
preamplifier and are intended to be used in a wired channel have a factory-preset 
gain trim which is not adjustable.  If the audio loudness is too loud or too soft to 
adequately match this pre-set gain trim setting, one has no other choice except to 
substitute a different microphone type (different brand or model) that is a better 
match to the situation.<br><br>

Some microphones are available with a selection of different capsules that may be mounted
in or on them.  Other microphones include two or more capsules with a switch to select 
how the capsules are connected to the electrical output of the microphone.  (The "Blue" 
brand of microphones has made a sort of specialty of selling microphones with multiple 
capsules.  The "Blue Yeti" microphone and its variants have multiple capsules built in 
and selectable by a switch.  The "Blue Bottle" has a selection of optional capsules 
than can be attached to the main housing of the microphone.  But Blue is not the first 
or only company to provide such offerings.) Even if a microphone has only one available 
capsule, the capsule is usually a replaceable part if the microphone is carefully 
disassembled.<br><br>  


<i>Shock Mount</i><br>

Most capsules are suspended inside a housing via a <i>shock mount</i>.  Sometimes the 
shock mount and the capsule are a single indivisible assembly.  A shock mount is usually a rubber 
assembly with some damping, arranged so that mechanical vibrations from handling
the microphone do not get mechanically coupled into the capsule and mixed with the audio.
Shock mounts can have varying degrees of sophistication or, in the case of inexpensive 
microphones, might be rather ineffective or even entirely absent, with the capsule 
mechanically fastened directly into the microphone housing.<br><br>


<i>Windscreen</i><br>

It is desirable that only sound gets to the capsule, no wind or breath noise.  There are 
three types of wind-sounds to consider.  <br><br>

1) The ordinary <b>breeze</b> of the day, such as is reported in the weather forecast, needs to 
be considered if the microphone is used outdoors.  This breeze can cause turbulent air 
flow over the capsule, which will create an obnoxious rustling sound.  Almost certainly 
the microphone's built-in windscreening will need to be supplemented.<br><br>

2) There is also wind caused by the <b>motion</b> of the microphone.  Suppose a microphone is 
handheld and the vocalist is not singing, holding the microphone near a thigh in a 
relaxed manner.  Then the vocalist raises the microphone to sing.  This type of motion 
is equivalent to a breeze of about 10 to 15 MPH.  If the vocalist is dancing or acting 
in a theatrical manner this type of breeze can be even greater.<br><br>

3)  There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive"><b>plosive</b></a> sounds in 
speech and singing.  These produce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzHscqWrrbc"
>puffs of air</a> that are expelled from the vocalist's mouth but are usually inaudible 
in daily life&mdash;until a microphone picks them up and emphasizes them.  Most 
microphones, if they are in just the wrong position, become sensitive to these plosives, 
distorting the sound.  The area of maximum plosive turbulence is usually about three inches 
straight out from the mouth and a half-inch down.  Hold the capsule of the microphone 
almost anywhere else for a better sound! To mitigate these three sources of wind noise, 
most microphones include some windscreening.<br><br>

Because windscreening can muffle the sound, as if you are listening through a pillow, 
windscreening built into a microphone is usually kept to a minimum.  Ideally, vocalists 
should be trained to avoid putting the microphone in the stream of plosives.  
Only enough windscreening is usually provided for use outside the stream of plosives.  
Optional external windscreens, often in the form of foam socks that cover the microphone, 
sometimes in the form of a mesh disk suspended between the vocalist and the microphone, 
can be used to add additional windscreening if desired.<br><br>  



<i>Microphone</i><br>

<b>For the purpose of this tutorial, a microphone is the assembly of hardware that 
consists of the capsule and, if necessary, the pre-amplifier, and the shock mounting, 
and the housing around that and the windscreening to ideally allow only sound to reach 
the capsule. A microphone might also contain various switches (e.g. on/off)</b>.<br><br>

There will be a separate page in this tutorial on the electrical connection between 
the microphone and the mixer board or wireless transmitter or PA amplifier.  There 
will also be a separate page on handling and using microphones.<br><br>
