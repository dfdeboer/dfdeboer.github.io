            <b>Guest Access to Professor De Boer's<br>
                 courses@dordt web pages</b></p><p>

Professor De Boer considers requests for guest access to his 
courses@dordt web pages on a case-by-case basis.  Generally 
anyone who has a valid but temporary interest in a course may 
have guest access.  This includes relatives of students, other 
faculty members who want to know what is happening in the course, 
Dordt graduates who have taken the course, and high-school 
students who are considering attending Dordt College.  Others who 
have valid interests might also be granted guest access.  The 
courses@dordt web pages are not open to the public at large due 
to copyright restrictions on some of the material posted 
there.</p><p> 

Guest access allows you to see virtually everything posted 
electronically that a student in the course can see.  This 
includes electronic copies of most course handouts and lab 
handouts.  Guests do not have access to any grades or lists of 
students however.</p><p> 

To gain guest access to Professor De Boer's courses@dordt web 
pages, <a href="mailto:ddeboer@dordt.edu">send him an e-mail</a>.  
Include the following in your e-mail:</p><ul><li>

   Your return e-mail address, if different from the address you are 
   sending from.</li><br><br><li>

   The course number(s) for which you would like guest access.  (e.g. "I 
   would like guest access to EGR 204 and EGR 
   304.")</li><br><br><li>

   The reason(s) for your request.</li></ul><p>
                                            
 You will receive a personal reply within a few days. (Except if 
you make your request when classes are not in session. Then it 
might take a few weeks if Professor De Boer is on vacation.)  If 
guest access is granted, you will receive further instructions 
and a password.</p><p>

To give you some idea of what else is available on course@dordt, 
an old <a href="screen.htm">screen-shot is available for the EGR 220 
course</a>.  The links on that page won't work because it is just 
a screen-shot.  The style of course@dordt has changed over the years,
but the screen shot gives you a good idea of the type of content 
available.  Ask for guest access if you want a functional 
page.</P>
