<p>Doug, </p>

<p>MRES is starting our search for an intern next summer in our 
transmission planning department.  Please pass this along to any 
students who you think would be interested.  We don't have a 
formal description yet, but the individual would be working on 
various projects that will give them exposure to the regional 
power system, utility modeling and software (PSS/E, MUST, 
ProMod), and database work relating to meter readings and 
verification for use in load and power factor calculations.  I 
plan on putting a notice out on the IEEE webpage, but individuals 
can send resumes to Terry Wolf (twolf@mrenergy.com).</p>

<p>Thanks for your assistance. </p>

<p>Regards, </p>

<p>John Weber </p>
