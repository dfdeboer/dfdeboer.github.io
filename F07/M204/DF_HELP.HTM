              Help for using Dfield at Dordt College

The Dfield solver is linked to the MATH 204 course page.  Just 
click on the icon.  It might take a few minutes to load.  Most of 
the operation of this program is intuitive. 
 
To get full credit your solution must show a dot at each initial 
condition, and no other dots that would confuse the matter.  You 
may set initial conditions and place the dots by setting initial 
conditions from the keyboard or by clicking on the point in the 
direction field that corresponds to the initial condition.  The 
keyboard method is more accurate however.  You should enter 
initial conditions via the keyboard when they are given 
numerically.  In the "Direction Field" Window, from the top menu 
click on "Solution" and then "Keyboard input of initial value." 

If you are using the mouse to select an initial condition, just 
before you click, you can read the initial condition in the lower 
left corner of the direction field window.  Write these numbers 
down just before you click if you need them for an answer.  
The bigger you make the direction field plot on your computer 
screen the more accurately you can click on an initial condition 
with your mouse cursor.  

On Sec 2.8, Ex 1-1 any reasonably close results will get 
full credit assuming that the initial conditions are correctly 
noted numerically (e.g. "x(0) = 0.009")  You may put Ex 1 - 4 on 
one plot and Ex. 5-8 on another plot.  Label each solution curve 
with the Exercise number.
