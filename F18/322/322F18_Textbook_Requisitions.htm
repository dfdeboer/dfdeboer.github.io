Thank you!  Below is what you submitted to the Bookstore:
<p><strong>EGR-322-01: Electronics I, Fall 2018</strong></p>
<p>If new editions become available before classes start, would you like to use the new editions?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>If yes, are you aware if a new edition is currently available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will the students enrolling in this course already have the textbook from a previous course that they themselves have taken?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Do you require a CD or access code, if one is available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will you be advising the students that they <strong>NEED</strong> to have their own textbook, that they may share a particular textbook, that they really don't need the textbook, or any other options you might share with the students?  <em>We would appreciate knowing this so that we can make a more responsible order decision on how many textbooks to order.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>
Some tests and the final exam in this course will be "open book." Each student will simultaneously need access to a textbook. Textbooks may not be shared during a test or during the final exam. Each student should personally bring a textbook to each class.  <br><br>

Electronic editions of the textbook will not be allowed for use on open book tests or on the final exam. </strong></p>

<p><b>HARDCOPY REQUIRED</b><br>
Electronic editions of the textbook will not be allowed for use on open book tests or on the final exam.  If you order the electronic edition you will have to print pages to bring to the tests with you.<br><br>

<b>INTERNATIONAL EDITION NOT SUPPORTED</b><br>
International editions of the textbook will not be supported by the instructor.  Often the vender assures that the international edition is virtually interchangeable with the domestic edition.  It has never worked that way in Professor DDB's experience.<br><br>

<b>PAPERBACK EDITION NOT SUPPORTED</b><br>
Paperbacks of this textbook are practically always international editions.  If you know the paperback is the domestic edition, then it is OK.<br><br>

<b>EACH STUDENT NEEDS A PERSONAL COPY</b><br>
Some tests and the final exam in this course will be &quot;open book.&quot;  Each student will simultaniously need access to a textbook.  Textbooks may not be shared during a test or during the final exam.<br><br>

<b>NCEES-approved CALCULATOR REQUIRED</b><br>
Students may only use an NCEES approved calculator for tests and the final exam. 
The approved list can be found here: <a href="http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/">http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/</a>
Most students choose a TI-36X-Pro model.  Further discussion can be found here:

<b>TEXTBOOK'S WEB SITE</b><br>
FYI this textbook has an accompanying web site that will be useful to this course.  Several appendices to the textbook and other resources are hosted at the textbook's web site.  See <a href="http://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780199339136/">http://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780199339136/</a> <br><br>
