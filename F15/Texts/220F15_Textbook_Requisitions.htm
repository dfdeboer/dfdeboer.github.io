<div class="title">Thank you!  Below is what you submitted to the Bookstore:</div>
<p><strong>EGR-220-01 PHYS-206-01: Linear Circuits</strong></p>
<p>If new editions become available before classes start, would you like to use the new editions?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>If yes, are you aware if a new edition is currently available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will the students enrolling in this course already have the textbook from a previous course that they themselves have taken?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong></strong></p>
<p>Do you require a CD or access code, if one is available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p>Will you be advising the students that they <strong>NEED</strong> to have their own textbook, that they may share a particular textbook, that they really don't need the textbook, or any other options you might share with the students?  <em>We would appreciate knowing this so that we can make a more responsible order decision on how many textbooks to order.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>A majority of the homework for this course will be electronically submitted and graded via the "Mastering Engineering" web site from Pearson-Prentice-Hall. An access code to that web site is required for each student. The "Mastering Engineering" web site includes an electronic edition of the textbook.</strong></p>

<div class="header2">Comments:</div>
<p>Professor De Boer will be assigning most of the homework using the "Mastering Engineering" web site. Each student is required to purchase an access code to the "Mastering Engineering" web site. An electronic copy of the 10th edition of the textbook is included with access to the web site. </p>

</p>Professor De Boer will require that only an NCEES approved calculator may be used on the tests and final exam. The list of NCEES approved calculators can be found here: <a href="http://ncees.org/exams/calculator-policy/">http://ncees.org/exams/calculator-policy/</a> A calculator with support for complex numbers (E.g. the "TI-36X Pro," or the Casio "fx-115ES PLUS" or the "HP 35S") is  especially useful for this course. </p>

<p>Optionally, students may purchase a hard-copy edition of the course textbook in addition to the access code to the web site. The older 9th edition is sufficiently similar to the 10th edition that Professor De Boer suggests purchasing a used copy of it (at a cost savings) instead of the 10th edition. (All students will have electronic access to the 10th edition via their access code.) The street price of a used copy (without access code) of the 9th edition, ISBN 978-0136114994, appears to be about $30 to $50 as of June, 2015.)</p>
