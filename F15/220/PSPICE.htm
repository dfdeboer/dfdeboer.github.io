             INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING <br>

PSpice is loaded on most engineering lab computers.  If you are 
willing to do your PSpice work on one of Dordt's computers it is not 
necessary for you to download it and install it on your personal
computer.</p><p>

Cadence offeres a "Lite" version of the software for free.  It 
has all the features and capabilities of the regular version 
except that the number of circuit elements it can simulate is
restricted.  This restriction has never been an issue with work
done by students here at Dordt.  Thus, for the purposes of this 
course, you would never be able to tell the difference between 
the lite version and the regular version.               </P><p>

To get started downloading, click on the PSpice logo (the image 
above).  There you can read more about the program.  Note that 
PSpice is downloaded as part of a larger software package called 
OrCAD.  After clicking on the logo above a new window opens and 
you have a choice.  <br><br>

<b>Option B.)</b>  (Recommended) If you only want to use the 
software to do homework for this class, you need only download 
the <I>OrCAD PCB Designer Lite DVD (Capture and PSpice Only)</i> 
version (646 MB).  Scroll down to find it since this is the 
second choice offered on the download page.  After installation 
it will occupy about 1.7&nbsp;GB of your hard drive.<br><br>

<b>Option A.)</b>  If you want the PCB editor and the complete 
OrCAD suite of software, download the <i>OrCAD PCB Designer Lite 
DVD</i> (980 MB).  After installation it will occupy about 
2.5&nbsp;GB of your hard drive.  This is the first choice offered 
on the download page.   
                                               </p><p>
                                               
PSpice was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29"
>forked</a> from an earlier program called SPICE.  You can
read more about SPICE <a href="http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/classes/IcBook/SPICE/"
>here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE"
>here</a>.  Practically all commands and features of spice are 
supported in the lite version of PSpice that we use here at 
Dordt College.  Thus documentation for SPICE can be used with 
and applied to PSpice.</p><p>
