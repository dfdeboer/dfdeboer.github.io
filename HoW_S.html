<h1>Introduction</h1><p>
Understanding the basics of sound, the connections of the equipment, 
and the purposes of each piece of equipment will help you understand how 
to set up and operate a sound system.  This requires a blend of technical 
skill and artistic imagination.  Technical skill helps you understand that, 
"If I do this, I can expect that." or "If I observe this problem, I should
do that."  Artistic imagination enables you to envision various ways that 
the event could be made to sound.  Sound can be altered in volume, tonal balance, 
stereo separation, amount of reverb, and of course the mix between the 
various sources of sound can be changed in many ways.  By imagining different 
ways that the event could sound, one may choose various technical strategies 
and settings to achieve a pleasing sound.</p><p>

This web page is dedicated just to the sound operations of Covenant Church.
This is specific to audio and does not include video or lighting.  The audio 
is further restricted to live-sound reinforcement and live audio streaming 
and does not include post-production editing and mastering.  
Feel free to comment, even if you are not a member or sound operator at 
Covenant Church.  You may address your comments to dfdeboer at the usual
ending for Google Mail, gmail.com.</p><p>

This web site is organized around a the theme of a lexicon of words associated
with live sound reinforcement and streaming audio.  As time passes the author
of this page will add more sections.  This style of organization will hopefully
allow for easy development of topics that are not necessarily related, but are
of interest.</p><p>

There are existing Lexicons about audio online, such as the <a 
href="https://www.teachmeaudio.com/glossary"
>Glossary from Teach Me Audio</a>. These have great breadth.  Presented here 
are a few words or phrases in greater depth. 

<h1>A Lexicon of Sound</h1><p>

We hear that, "words matter."  With that in mind, here are some definitions.
