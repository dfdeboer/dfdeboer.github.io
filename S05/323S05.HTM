Note 1) If a "#" follows the "returned" date, then the solution
key is posted on the cork board across the hall from room S233.

Note 2) Problems sets shown above with no "assigned" date are 
tentative.  More problems might be added, expected due dates 
might change, but problems shown will eventually be assigned.

Note 3) A "+" mark in front of the problem number means an answer 
is in the text, in Appendix H.

Note 4) Asterisks (*) indicate more difficult or more time-
consuming problems.  The more asterisks, the more difficult.

Note 5) The letter "D" in front of a problem number indicates a 
design oriented problem.  The student may need to use some 
judgment in understanding what the problem statement is 
requesting.  (Ask Prof. De Boer if you are in doubt.)

      the lists above for Tests #1 and #2 plus all the lab 
      handouts and homework assignments, plus. . . 
           Chapter 7 Sections 7-1 through 7-4
           Chapter 8 Sections 8-1 through 8-8.
      Prerequisite material covered in EGR 322, Electronics I, 
      may also appear on the exam, although specific testing for 
      that content is not a goal of this exam.  There will be no 
      questions on the final exam that require knowledge of the 
      SPICE language or the PSPICE or ORCAD programs.  There also 
      will be no questions on device physics (e.g. Section 3.7). 

   Grade Distribution:  Will be posted when the exam is graded.
