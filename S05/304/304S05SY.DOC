  An in-depth study of design of microprocessor and microprocessor based circuits and s
ystems.  Hardware issues such as parallel and serial I/O, bus structure, grounding and shielding and D/A and A/D conversion are studied.  Software topics such as assembly language, structured programming, and interrupt driven systems are also covered.  La
b exercises provide design experience using a particular microprocessor or microcontroller.  Prerequisites: Engineering 204, 220.\cell }\pard \intbl {\f94 \row }\trowd \trgaph108\trleft-108 \cellx1530\cellx9450 \pard \sb120\intbl {\b\f94 Textbooks:\cell }

\i\f94 Creational Structure}{\f94 :  Students will design a system that uses an embedded processor.  The design will incorporate polled or interrupt driven input/output and a sensor to measure a 
physical quantity such as temperature, pressure, etc.  This is a primary goal of this course.
\par }{\i\f94 Contemporary Response}{\f94 :  Students will consider the application of norms for the design of appropriate ergonomics for an I/O interface.
\par }{\i\f94 Creational Development}{\f94 :  Students will study the historical development of some standards, such as for serial interfacing, and reflect on how these past developments now influence modern trends in computer engineering.  \cell }\pard

\intbl {\f94 \row }\pard \sb120\intbl {\b\f94 Laboratory:\cell }{\f94 
One or two design projects will be completed, each with a formal written report.  Design projects may be proposed by the students but must be approved in advance by the instructor.  Some laboratory time may be used to present project management and p
resentation techniques.  Grounds for lab project approval are based on the scope of the project and the relation of the project to the lecture material in class.  Depending on the scope of the project work undertaken, there usually will also be a number o
f short lab exercises with informal reports graded as homework.\cell }\pard \intbl {\f94 \row }\pard \sb120\intbl {\b\f94 Computer use:\cell }{\f94 A cross assembler or compiler will be used to support the microprocessor or microcontroller 
used in the lab, or else a language such as C or tiny basic may be used, as appropriate to the projects selected by the students.  Students are encouraged (but not required) to use programs such as Mathcad or Matlab for homework solutions where
 appropriate.\cell }\pard \intbl {\f94 \row }\trowd \trgaph108\trleft-108 \cellx1530\cellx9450 \pard \sb120\intbl {\b\f94 Means of \line Evaluation:\cell }{\f94 Homework (10%), Two Tests (20% each) Laboratory Project(s) (26%), Final Exam (24%)\cell
