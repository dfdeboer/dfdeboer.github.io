|  |       |       |       | In class on Wed. 4/27 we discussed |
|  |       |       |       | the due date for this assignment.  |
|  |       |       |       | The due date was changed from 5/03 |
|  |       |       |       | at 8 AM to 5/02 at 10 AM so that   |
|  |       |       |       | it could be graded and returned    |

|  |       |       |       | Also do this problem:              | 
|  |       |       |       | Overflow happens when the result of| 
|  |       |       |       | a math operation has too great a   | 
|  |       |       |       | magnitude to be represented with   | 
|  |       |       |       | the number of bits available in the| 
|  |       |       |       | hardware.  Given a 4-bit wide      | 
|  |       |       |       | adder such as is shown in Fig. 5-5 | 
|  |       |       |       | on page 206 in your text, invent   | 
|  |       |       |       | two addition problems which        | 
|  |       |       |       | illustrate the outcome when there  | 
|  |       |       |       | is no overflow.  Invent two more   | 
|  |       |       |       | addition problems that illustrate  | 
|  |       |       |       | overflow.  In each of the four     | 
|  |       |       |       | cases, specify the 4-bit words for | 
|  |       |       |       | A, B, and S.  How can a computer   | 
|  |       |       |       | detect overflow?                   |

Final Exam, Tuesday, 5/3 8:00 am - 10:30 am.
     Coverage:  Covers the whole course and lab.  About 2/3 of 
     the exam covers the material covered by tests #1 and #2. The 
     remaining third covers the course from test #2 to the end.  
     That includes these Chapters and Sections: 
                Chapter  6 Sections 6-5, 6-9
                Chapter  7 all except Sections 7-4, 7-10, 7-11.
                Chapter  8 only Sections 8-1, 8-2.
                Chapter  9 Sections 9-1 through 9-6
                Chapter 10 Sections 10-1 through 10-8
                Chapter 11 Sections 11-1 thru 11-9 omitting 11-7.

     Test Conditions:  Closed book, closed notes, no calculator.  
          Tables of instructions similar in style to the Z-80 
          tables used in the lab will be supplied to cover any 
          CPU instructions mentioned on or needed for the exam.  
          (Both types of tables--op-code and RTL--will be

                       PEER GRADING RUBRIC
                       -------------------
The purposes of peer grading are to. . .
    (1) provide motivation for keeping up with the course, and
    (2) to help each other learn how to solve problems, and
    (3) to learn how to communicate our findings to others.

"A" The work shows a sincere effort.  The presentation of the
    work shows how the problem was solved.  I can read it without
    difficulty.  (Correctness is not required.)

"B" The work shows a sincere effort but is incomplete.  Or, the
    work does not show all of what I would like to know about how
    the problem was solved.  Or, the work is hard to read, but
    mostly readable with effort.

"C" Something is there and some sincere effort is shown.

"D" (This grade is not allowed)

"F" Nothing is there.  (The student would have no basis upon
    which to participate in class discussion.  The Prof. gives 
    this grade since nothing was turned in for peer grading.)

Plus and minus grades are not allowed.  Comments from the peer
grader to the student being graded are encouraged.  Please write
them on the back of the page or in the margin so that the student
may correct mistakes without re-copying the work.

|   |       |       |       | Note:  If the any of the COPY,    |
|   |       |       |       |    LOAD, or DUMP keys do not work,|
|   |       |       |       |    then some of the monitor code  |
|   |       |       |       |    stored in EEPROM has been      |
|   |       |       |       |    accidentally erased.  Ask a    |
|   |       |       |       |    lab TA for help.               |
|   |       |       |       |                                   |
|   |       |       |       | Note:  The appendix to the lab    |
|   |       |       |       |    handout has important info     |
|   |       |       |       |    that can save you time.  Use   |
|   |       |       |       |    the program shown in Figure 1  |
|   |       |       |       |    of the lab handout and try     |
|   |       |       |       |    storing a the program in EEPROM|
|   |       |       |       |    as described in the appendix.  |
|   |       |       |       |    Then remove the power from the |
|   |       |       |       |    Fox Kit, and re-apply power.   |
|   |       |       |       |    This erases the RAM but not the|
|   |       |       |       |    EEPROM.  You should then be    |
|   |       |       |       |    able to load the RAM from the  |
|   |       |       |       |    EEPROM as described in the     |
|   |       |       |       |    appendix.                      |

|   |       |       |       | 1.) "One-hot state assignment" is |
|   |       |       |       | further discussed in your textbook|
|   |       |       |       | on pages 380-382.                 |
|   |       |       |       |                                   |
|   |       |       |       | 2.) Professor De Boer recommends  |
|   |       |       |       | that you only use logic blocks    |
|   |       |       |       | from the Maxplus2 library, and    |
|   |       |       |       | then only blocks named 74xxx or   |
|   |       |       |       | a_74xxx.  This way you can build  |
|   |       |       |       | your circuit either on a bread-   |
|   |       |       |       | board or on a UP-2 kit.           |
|   |       |       |       |                                   |
|   |       |       |       | 3.) The circuit shown in the lab  |
|   |       |       |       | handout, Figure 3, cannot be      |
|   |       |       |       | built on a UP-2 kit.  Consult with|
|   |       |       |       | Professor De Boer for options.    |
|   |       |       |       |                                   |

p236, Problem 5-3*.  Four of the given unsigned numbers are too 
   large to represent as signed integers with the same number of 
   bits.  In a real computer a complement operation is equivalent 
   to negation and would result in overflow in these four cases 
   if the given number was truly taken as UNSIGNED.  
   Alternatively a leading zero could be padded onto each given 
   number to convert the number to the 1's or 2's complement 
   number system before the 1's or 2's complement is taken.  The 
   answers shown online do not mention these issues.  Thus, the 
   answers shown online are not the negations of UNSIGNED 
   integers.  They are the negations of signed integers with the 
   issue of overflow ignored.
