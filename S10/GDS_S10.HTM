              PROFESSOR DE BOER'S METHOD OF GRADING</b></p><p>

<b>THE MAIN THING: Grades Recognize Achievement</b><br>
"Grades should mean something more than flattery. Grades speak to 
the world, not just to classmates, parents or a campus. 
Eventually performance shows and counts, and must be competitive 
on the merits. I encourage students to sharpen skills now by 
selecting challenge. . . .  When you evaluate courses (or 
colleges) consider that thoughtful professors do not give grades, 
they assign them on the basis of the evidence provided by a 
student's work."                       <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp<small> 
     (<i>quoted from Professor S.A. Miller 
          at Hamilton College, New York State</i>)</small><br><br>

In contrast, grades are not based on degree of effort or amount of
time spent studying, or maintenance of self-esteem.  A poor grade 
on a test or report does not result in a general opportunity to 
earn extra credit.<br><br> 

<b>Major Items are Letter Graded</B><BR> 
All major items (tests, lab reports, etc.) are ultimately 
assigned letter grades according to the following 
rubric:<br><blockquote><small> 

A                                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Exceptional                                              <br>
B                                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Normal 
       (<i>good enough for graduate school or employment</i>)<br>
C                                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Graduation minimum
       (<i>minimally employable in discipline</i>)            <br>
D                                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Unsatisfactory 
       (<i>with changes progress may still be possible</i>)  <br>
F                                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Failure                                 </small></blockquote>

Plus and minus modifiers may be used, for example "B+" meaning 
normal but bordering on exceptional.  (The grades "A+," "F+", and 
"F&ndash;" will not be used.  Those grades will be rounded to 
the letter.)<br><br> 

Letter grades for lab reports are explained in a booklet by Prof. 
De&nbsp;Boer titled, "How to Write a Lab Report."  Test grades 
are derived from a grading curve which varies from test to test 
in order to maintain the rubric shown above.  Professor De Boer 
writes tests with a goal of 65 to 70 points out of 100 
representing normal performance, or a "B."  Professor De Boer 
realizes his curves are typically about 10 or 15 points lower 
than the traditional curve of 80% being a "B."  In other words, 
his tests may be harder than average, but he offers a more 
favorable curve in compensation.  <br><br> 

Only letter grades count toward the course grade.  When Prof. 
De&nbsp;Boer calculates course grades he ignores all the raw 
point scores and other feedback he may have given students.  
(Exception: If a course grade falls on or very near a 
borderline, he will consider those and other factors such as 
class participation when deciding to round  the grade up or 
down.)<br><br> 

<b>Why Prof. De Boer Curves Grades</b><br>
Grading rubrics or curves serve to normalize grades so that they 
can be understood via the chart above.  Professor De Boer uses 
the normal performance of all the students he has ever taught in 
a particular course as the norm, not the class average.  This 
avoids some of the disadvantages of grading on a curve.  For 
example it is possible in Professor De Boer's classes for 
everyone at the end of a particular semester to get course grades 
of "A."  At least in theory, this would happen if everyone did 
work that was well above the norm of past students.  You can read 
more about <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_on_a_curve"
          >grading on a curve</a> from Wikipedia. 

<p><b>Minor Items Earn Points (e.g. homework)</b><br>
Each minor item is assigned a point value.  A homework problem of 
average complexity and importance will be assigned about 5 
points.  Problems that are assigned more points are more 
important or more complex. <br><br> 

The total number of minor item points possible in the entire course
is typically about 600 to 700 for courses employing peer grading 
and about 350 to 500 for other courses.  The total depends on how 
the course actually transpires and thus cannot be exactly tallied 
at the start of the course.<br><br>

Points are earned according to the following 
rubric:                                    <br><blockquote><small>

   More points than the problem is worth: (e.g. "6/4")<br>
   A rare case of exceptional work.<br>
   The extra points amount to extra credit, indulgences if you 
   will, to be applied against mistakes on other similar 
   assignments.<br><br> 

   All possible points awarded<br>
   Equivalent to "A" (e.g. "4/4")<br>
   The work is done correctly.<br><br> 

   All but one or two points awarded<br> 
   Equivalent to "B" (e.g. "3/4")<br> 
   A minor mistake like a missing unit or a sign error.<br><br> 

   Half of the points possible<br>
   Equivalent to "C" (e.g. "2/4")<br>
   A mistake but a reasonable method of solution is evident.<br><br>

   One or two points<br>
   Equivalent to "D" (e.g. "1/4")<br>
   The method of solution is wrong, but the work is more than 
   piddling.<br><br>

   Zero points<br>
   Equivalent to "F" (e.g. "0/4")<br>
   The problem was not attempted or the work is piddling.  
                                               </small></blockquote>
The points earned for each minor item are added together in a 
category.  For example, "regular graded homework" is a category 
in each of Prof. De&nbsp;Boer's courses and in some courses, 
"peer grading" is a category.  These points are then applied 
against a curve to derive a letter grade for the category.  The 
curve is quite simple.  Take your total earned points in a 
category, multiply by four, and then divide by the total number 
of points possible and <i>truncate</i> the result to three 
significant figures.  (e.g. 2.4999999 becomes 2.49)  This results 
in something called <i>grade points</i>.  The letter grade is 
assigned according to the following curve:              
<blockquote><small> 

4.00&ndash;3.75 &nbsp; A                                       <br>
3.74&ndash;3.45 &nbsp; A&ndash;                            <br><br>

3.44&ndash;3.15 &nbsp; B+                                      <br>
3.14&ndash;2.85 &nbsp; B                                       <br>
2.84&ndash;2.50 &nbsp; B&ndash;                            <br><br>

2.49&ndash;2.15 &nbsp; C+                                     <br>
2.14&ndash;1.85 &nbsp; C                                       <br>
1.84&ndash;1.55 &nbsp; C&ndash;                            <br><br>

1.54&ndash;1.45 &nbsp; D+                                     <br>
1.44&ndash;1.35 &nbsp; D                                       <br>
1.34&ndash;1.24 &nbsp; D&ndash;                            <br><br>

1.23&ndash;0.00 &nbsp; F                  <br></small></blockquote>

Generally, grade points near 4 mean "A", near 3 mean "B", etc.  
Notice that the "A" and "D" ends of the curve favor the extreme 
grades.  In other words, you need 2.50 grade points at minimum to 
get a "B&ndash;" but you only need 3.45 grade points to get an 
"A&ndash;".  This is done because it is hard for very good 
students to average an occasional mistake with some even better 
than perfect work.  Instead, the curve is lowered for them.  
Similarly, it is too easy for a very poor student to gain a few 
points by guesswork, and so the curve is raised for them.  
Students in the "B" and "C" range will naturally have some better 
grades to average with some lower grades so no adjustments are 
needed for them.  <br><br>

Here is an example.                             <blockquote><small>
A student has done nine homework problem sets so far.<br>
The grades on the problem sets are, <br><br> 

12/13, 11/11, 10/16, 7/9, 11/12, 12/13, 17/19, 13/16, and 7/7.<br><br>

The total points earned are <br><br>

12 + 11 + 10 +  7 + 11 + 12 + 17 + 13 + 7 = 100<br><br>
                
The total points possible are <br><br>

13 + 11 + 16 +  9 + 12 + 13 + 19 + 16 + 7 = 116<br><br>

Now (100 * 4)/116 = 3.44827586 which is truncated to 3.44<br>
That curves to a grade of "B+" for the homework category.  With 
just one more point earned, this student would have had an 
"A&ndash;." 
                                               </small></blockquote>

In calculation of the course grade only the letter grade for the 
category is used.<br><br> 

<B>Grade-Point Based Calculations</B><BR> 
Gradepoints are the numeric basis for calculating the course 
grade.  Each of the letter grades from each category of grades is 
converted to a grade point value according to this rule: 

                                             <blockquote><small> 
   A &nbsp; = 4.00<br>
   A&ndash; = 3.67<br><br>

   B+ = 3.33<br>
   B &nbsp; = 3.00<br>
   B&ndash; = 2.67<br><br>

   C+ = 2.33<br>
   C &nbsp; = 2.00<br>
   C&ndash; = 1.67<br><br>

   D+ = 1.33<br>
   D &nbsp; = 1.00<br>
   D&ndash; = 0.67<br><br>

   F &nbsp; = 0.00                         </small></blockquote>

After conversion to a grade point value, each category grade is 
multiplied by a weight factor given on the course syllabus.  The 
products are added up and truncated to three significant figures 
giving a weighted average grade point value for entire the 
course.  That is turned into a letter grade using a curve similar 
to the one above for homework letter grades.  (Prof. De&nbsp;Boer 
reserves the right to adjust the course curve somewhat, but 
usually the curve used is nearly identical to the homework 
curve.)  The letter grade that rusults is reported to the 
registrar as your grade for the course.  <br><br> 

Here is an example:                     <blockquote><small>

   The course syllabus shows this "means of evaluation:" <br>
   Homework 10%, two tests 20% each, lab report 15%, 
   computer project 10%, final exam 25%.<br><br>

   The student has earned these grades:<br>
   Homework: A&ndash;<br>
   Test One: B+<br>
   Test Two: A<br>
   Lab Report: C&ndash;<br>
   Computer Project: F (nothing was turned in)<br>
   Final Exam: B+<br><br>

   The grades are converted to grade points and then 
   weighted:<br><br>

   Homework:  A&ndash;  &rarr; 3.67 &rarr; 3.67 * 0.10 = 0.3670<br>
   Test One:         B+ &rarr; 3.33 &rarr; 3.33 * 0.20 = 0.6660<br>
   Test Two:         A  &rarr; 4.00 &rarr; 4.00 * 0.20 = 0.8000<br>
   Lab Report: C&ndash; &rarr; 1.67 &rarr; 1.67 * 0.15 = 0.2505<br>
   Computer Project: F  &rarr; 0.00 &rarr; 0.00 * 0.10 = 0.0000<br>
   Final Exam:       B+ &rarr; 3.33 &rarr; 3.33 * 0.25 = 0.8235<br><br>

   The products are added:<br><br>

   0.3670 + 0.6660 + 0.8000 + 0.2505 + 0.0000 + 0.8235 = 2.9070<br><br>

   The result is truncated to three significant figures, 2.90, and 
   the grade is looked up on a curve (same as for homework).  In 
   this case the course grade is "B." 
   
                                                  </small></blockquote>

<b>Grade Reports From courses@dordt</b><br>
Prof. De Boer uses <a 
href="http://courses.dordt.edu">courses@dordt</a> to record 
student grades.  You may look up your grades in courses@dordt at 
any time.  However, Prof. De&nbsp;Boer has not figured out a way 
to make courses@dordt compute course grades using the system 
described here.  Courses@dordt keeps a good record of your grades 
on each graded item, but the course grade reported by 
courses@dordt is not used by Prof. De&nbsp;Boer and thus you should 
ignore it for his classes.<br><br> 

At the end of  the semester Prof. De&nbsp;Boer exports the grades 
from course@dordt to a spreadsheet that has all his methods built 
into it.  That spreadsheet computes the course grades that get 
reported to the registrar.
