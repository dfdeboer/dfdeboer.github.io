<b>The purposes of peer grading are to. . .</b>      <blockquote>
    (1) provide motivation for keeping up with the course, and
                                                             <br>
    (2) to help each other learn how to solve problems, and  <br>
    (3) to learn how to communicate our findings to others.  <br>
                                            <br><br></blockquote>

Grades are given as described below:                         <br>
                                                             <br>
<b>"A" The work shows a sincere effort.</b>          <blockquote>
    The presentation of the work shows how the problem was 
    solved.  It can be read it without difficulty.  (Correctness 
    is not required.)                   <br><br><br></blockquote>

<b>"B" The work shows a sincere effort but is incomplete.</b>
                                                     <blockquote>  
    The work does not show all of what a student who does not 
    understand the problem would like to know about how the 
    problem was solved.  Or, the work is hard to read, but mostly 
    readable with effort.               <br><br><br></blockquote>

<b>"C" Something is there and some sincere effort is shown.</b>
                                                         <br><br>

<b>"D" (This grade is not allowed)</b><br><br>

<b>"F" Nothing is there.</b>                         <blockquote>
    The Prof. gives this grade since when nothing was turned in 
    for peer grading.  Students may give this grade if what was 
    turned in has no meaningful content other than perhaps the 
    problem statements.                 <br><br><br></blockquote>

Plus and minus grades are not allowed.  Comments from the peer
grader to the student being graded are encouraged.  Please write
them on the back of the page or in the margin so that the student
may correct mistakes without re-copying the work.</p>
