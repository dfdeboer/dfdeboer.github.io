                   HOMEWORK STANDARDS</b><br>
            For Professor De Boer's Classes</p>

<P><B>Learn by Showing&mdash;Earn Grades by Showing How to 
Solve</B><a name="Show_How"></a><BR> The 
overall goal of doing homework is to learn by showing how 
problems are solved.  You need to present a clear sequence of 
rational statements to show how a problem is solved, not simply 
a correct answer.</p><p> 

Skipped steps may be interpreted as a lack of understanding on 
your part and may be graded down accordingly. </p><p> 

You must write something to show that you know how to solve the 
problem, especially if the answer is given.  (After all, you 
cannot expect credit for simply copying the answer!) Oftentimes 
you will use equations and math to show how you solved the 
problem, but sometimes you will need to explain how you solved 
the problem by using a sentence or two. </p><p> 



<B>Type of Paper</b><a name="Paper"></a><BR>
                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &mdash;Use letter size paper (about 8.5" x 11")<BR>
                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &mdash;Paper ripped out of a spiral binder is not acceptable unless<BR>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       you neatly cut off the ragged edge. <BR> 
                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &mdash;Engineering paper is recommended but not required. 
                                                      <br></p><p>
<B>Staple</B><a name="Staple"></a><BR>
Staple in the upper left corner if there is more than one page. 
                                                      <BR></P><P>

<B>One Side Only</B><a name="One_Side_Only"></a><BR>
Write on only one side of each sheet of paper.  Do not write on 
the back side of the paper.  Exception:  Computer-printed pages 
may be printed on both sides in order to conserve paper. </P><P> 

<B>Use a Pencil</B><a name="Pencil"></a><BR>
Most engineering problems include too much detail to hold in your 
head without writing intermediate steps down.  Thus you need to 
write in order to think.  But then mistakes happen because you 
started writing before thinking all the way through the problem.  
By using a pencil you can erase your mistakes.  Writing, 
thinking, writing more, erasing, re-writing, and so forth is the 
best and <i>fastest</i> way to solve engineering problems.   
Keeping a neat and easy-to-read page by erasing and re-writing is 
the right way to work.  Write a lot and when needed, 
erase.<p></p> 

A good quality 0.5&nbsp;mm mechanical pencil (e.g. Pentel brand 
or equivalent) and a good white plastic eraser (e.g. Pentel 
"Click") will pay for themselves many times over with time saved 
when used generously.  This equipment is available at the Dordt 
Bookstore and at other local merchants such as The Pencil Box and 
Walmart. </P><P> 

<B>Page Heading</B><a name="Heading"></a><BR>
Put the course number, problem set number, date, and your name at 
the top of each sheet of paper.  Example:                <BR><BR>
EGR 999
                         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
                         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
PS#99
                                             &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
9/9/2099
                                                     &nbsp;&nbsp;
Van VanderVander</P><BR><P>

<B>Neat Page Layout</B><a name="Neat"></a><BR>
Write legibly.  Consider using white space to set off important 
parts of the problem or answers.  Boxes and underlining can also 
be helpful for the grader.  You may be graded down if the grader 
has difficulty deciphering what you have written or finding an 
answer. </P><P> 

<B>One Problem Per Page (usually)</B><a name="One_Problem"></a><BR>
Start each new problem at the top of a new page.  Exception: if 
the problem is short enough to finish it on the same page you 
started it.  If the problem takes more than one page, that is 
OK, you may continue on second and subsequent pages if needed, 
but <i>only if the problem started at the top of a new page</i>.  
You may be graded down for violating this rule.  </P><P> 

<B>Problem Summary Required</B><a name="Summary"></a><BR>
Start each problem with a summary of the problem statement.  As 
an alternative, you may photocopy the problem statement page, cut 
the problem statement out of the photocopy, and paste it onto 
your homework with a glue stick.</P><P>

<B>Units</B><a name="Units"></a><BR>
When the problem statement includes units (seconds, volts, etc.) 
then the answer should include appropriate units. </P><P>

<B>Significant Digits, No Leading Decimals</B><a name="Sig_Figs"></a><BR>
Use an appropriate number of significant digits for your answers 
(often 3 digits unless the answer is obviously an integer 
quantity) and use engineering or scientific notation 
appropriately.  Do not allow leading decimals.  (Right: 0.125,    
Wrong: .125) </P><P>

<B>Graphs--Label Axes and Make 'em BIG</B><a name="Graphs"></a><BR>
Graphs should be an appropriate size.  If the graph is an answer, 
this usually means at least two inches high and 3 inches wide.  
It is also necessary that the graph be appropriately scaled.  If 
you can cover the interesting area of the graph with your thumb, 
the graph is either too small or not scaled appropriately.  
<B>Title</B> the graph and <B>label both axes</B> with 
<B>quantity</B> and <B>units</B> where appropriate.  See Figure 1 
below.</P> 

           <P align="center"><IMG 
Src="../cd_common/HWSTD/graph.gif"><BR>
       <B>Figure 1.  An example of a properly labeled <BR>
              graph that is large enough.</B></P><P><BR>

<B>Proofs (Also "Show," "Explain," "Derive," Etc.)</B>
<a name="Proofs"></a><BR>
You cannot convince most people by simply telling them the 
"correct answer."  People want to know more.  Sometimes we need 
proof.  Note:  Words like "show," "explain," "derive," etc. 
usually mean the same thing as "prove."<br><br> 

An engineering proof is a chain of statements leading from given 
information to a conclusion.  This chain of statements must be 
accompanied by the names of the relevant definitions, theorems, 
principles, and so forth.  (In a normal problem solution you only 
show the chain of statements, omitting the names and assuming the 
reader will recognize the definitions, theorems, etc. that have 
been used.)   <BR><BR> 

Engineering is about technical problems in a social context.  
Engineering is not simply applied math and science.  This means 
that an engineering proof needs to convince people by exposing a 
thought process which establishes the believed truth of some 
statement.  Generally, you cannot do a proof by computer because 
the computer does not expose the thought processes, it only gets 
"the right answer."  The "right answer" alone is not convincing.  
</P><P>                                

<B>Use of Calculators and Computers</B><a name="Calculators"></a><BR>
Use calculators and computers appropriately to perform routine 
and tedious operations and calculations.  Computers are also 
ideal for producing clear and accurate graphs.</p><p> 

You may be graded down for using a calculator or computer to do a 
trivial operation.  For some examples, you should know how to do 
simple definite integrals without needing a calculator.  You 
should also know the sines and cosines of common angles such as 
cos(0) = 1, and you should know simple exponentials and logs such 
as exp(0) = 1 and ln(2<i>e</i>) = ln(2) + 1.  Relying on a 
calculator for these is about as rewarding as watching your friend 
play your favorite video game instead of learning to excel at 
the game yourself.</p><p> 

If you will not be allowed to use a calculator during the tests, 
consider doing some homework calculations entirely by hand so 
that you are prepared better for the tests.</P><P> 

Never use a computerized symbolic math program (e.g. the 
"symbolics" menu in MathCAD or the equivalent in your calculator) 
to do work that you don't know how to check.  Students who try 
this frequently get the answer wrong, have no way to realize the 
answer is wrong, and never learn how to solve the problem.  Even 
if the answer is in some technical mathematical sense correct, it 
might be in a useless form which betrays your ignorance.  
Example: <br><i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) = exp(<i>it</i>) + 
exp(&ndash;<i>it</i>) when a useful solution is 
<br><i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) = 2cos(<i>t</i>) Those expressions of 
<i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) are technically equivalent, but would you know 
what the first one means? </p><p> 

If you use a computer program (e.g. Mathcad) to help you solve a 
problem, you <i>must print the file and staple it to your 
homework</i>.  If you write a program (Matlab, Java, Visual 
Basic, etc.) print the source code (use a fixed pitch font such 
as "Courier New" if you have a choice) and print the output of 
the program too.  Missing a printout?  Credit may be denied! 
</P><P> 

If you use an unusual feature of your calculator, say an equation 
solver, definite integral solver, or matrix inverse operator, 
make a marginal note.  (e.g. "Used matrix inverse on my TI-89 
calculator.")  If you use such a feature repeatedly, you only 
need to note your method once, near the first instance. </p><P>

<B>Reference Books</B><a name="References"></a><BR>
If you use a table of integrals or trig. ID or a theorem or other 
such material from a reference book, you need to cite the source.  
(e.g. "Used table of integrals in calc. book by Edwards & Penny, 
4th edition."  Subsequent citations can be even shorter, e.g. 
"Integral Table.")  Since this is homework, a full citation (such 
as in IEEE or APA or MLA style) is not required so long as your 
classmates could reasonably find your source from the information 
given. </P><P>

                                              <a name="DYOW"></a>
<B>Do Your Own Work</B><a name="Do_Your_Own_Work"></a><BR>
Presenting someone else's work as your own work is called 
<i>plagiarism</i>. Working from another student's paper, or from 
an e-mail or a computer file that essentially contains the 
solution, or using someone else's graded homework from a previous 
offering of the course are just a few ways to commit plagiarism.  
Professor De Boer also counts giving such information as 
plagiarism.  Keep your papers and computer files private.  The 
only times when you may legitimately share are during peer 
grading in class (if peer grading is offered) and any work done 
in connection with a team in the lab, in which case the team may 
share any of their own materials among themselves whenever the 
result will be a single project or lab report. <P></P> 

Using the Internet to find resource materials to help you 
understand a subject so that you may solve a homework problem is 
acceptable, even laudable.  In contrast, using the Internet to 
find or purchase solutions to copy (or "work") from, is 
plagiarism.<br><br>

Out-of-the-classroom communications among students about homework 
and other aspects of the class must be verbal or text-based 
(face to face or electronic) communications only, except that 
graded work may be entirely shared with classmates who have 
their own copy of the same graded homework assignment. (If you 
desire, you may compare your grades and solution techniques.)  
These communications must be along the lines of helping your 
colleague solve problems for himself or herself.  For example, 
saying, "You need to use such-and-such a theorem to solve that 
problem" is good.  "I think you made a math error because your 
method seems right," is another example of the right type of 
communication.  Even "I got five point nine one for the answer," 
is acceptable.  (Credit is given only for showing how to get 
the answer, not for the answer itself.)<br><br> 

It is not OK to recite entire equations step-by-step leading to 
the solution.  It is not OK to show your friend your solution or 
a part of your solution before the homework is handed in.  If 
your friend is really stuck, you should probably refer him or 
her to the course instructor for help&mdash;that's what the 
instructor is here for after all.  If you desire more help than 
this rule allows, see the section below, "Help is 
Available."</P><P> 

The above is in addition to Dordt's policy on <A HREF= 
"http://www.dordt.edu/campus_life/student_handbook/general_information.shtml#academic_dishonesty"
>Academic Dishonesty</A>.</p><p> 

Professor C.S. Lewis was once asked by another professor what he 
did about plagiarism.  Here is his advise, which Prof. De Boer 
thinks is insightful:  
<blockquote>
   I told him I was not a detective nor even a schoolmaster, nor 
   a nurse, and that I absolutely refused to take any precaution 
   against this puerile trick; that I'd as soon think it my 
   business to see that he washed behind his ears or wiped his 
   bottom.  He... [dropped out] of his own accord the next week 
   and I never saw him again.  I think you ought to make a 
   general announcement of that sort....  It is bad for them to 
   think this is "up to you."  Flay them alive if you 
   <i>happen</i> to detect them; but don't let them feel that you 
   are a safeguard against the effects of their own idleness.<br> 
       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What staggers me is how any man can 
   prefer the galley-slave labour of transcription* to the 
   freeman's work of attempting [the assignment] on his 
   own.<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you need (or want) help more frequently, consult the secretary 
at the ASK center and request "peer tutoring." (Or fill in an 
online form to make the request, see <a 
href="https://denis.dordt.edu/offices/ask_center/">this 
page</a>** and click on the "Peer Tutoring" link to get started.) 
Professor De Boer believes that the grade of most any student can 
be improved by about a half or a full letter grade simply by 
routine participation in the tutorial services of the ASK 
center.</p><p> 

Tutorial help is available for many 100 and 200 numbered courses 
at Dordt College, and for some other courses too, so <a
