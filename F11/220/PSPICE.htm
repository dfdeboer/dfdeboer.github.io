             INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOWNLOADING <br>

          FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH EGR 220, PHYS 206<br></td></tr>

PSpice is loaded on most engineering lab computers.  If you are 
willing to do your PSpice work on one of Dordt's computers it is not 
necessary for you to download it and install it on your personal
computer.</p><p>

Cadence offeres a "Demo" version of the software for free.  It 
has all the features and capabilities of the regular version 
except that the number of circuit elements it can simulate is
restricted.  This restriction has never been an issue with work
done by students here at Dordt.  Thus, for the purposes of this 
course, you would never be able to tell the difference between 
the Demo version and the regular version.               </P><p>

To get started downloading, click on the PSpice logo (the image 
above).  There you can read more about the program.  Note that 
PSpice is downloaded as part of a larger software package called 
ORCAD.  The "download" link is in small blue type near the lower
right of the window in a frame labeled "Related Info." Click on
"ORCAD Downloads."</p><p>

After clicking on "ORCAD Downloads" you have a choice.  <br><br>
<b>Option A.)</b>  (Recommended) If you only want to use the 
software to do homework for this class, you need only download 
the "Capture and PSpice Only" version of the "ORCAD Demo DVD."  
This is the second choice offered on the download page.<br><br>

<b>Options B.)</b>  If you want the PCB editor and the complete 
ORCAD suite of software, download the "ORCAD Demo DVD" (720 MB).  
After installation it will occupy about 2 GB of your hard drive.  
This is the first choice offered on the download page.   
                                               </p><p>
                                               
PSpice was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29"
>forked</a> from an earlier program called SPICE.  You can
read more about SPICE <a href="http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/classes/icbook/spice/"
>here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE"
>here</a>.  Practically all commands and features of spice are 
supported in the demo version of PSpice that we use here at 
Dordt College.  Thus documentation for SPICE can be used with 
and applied to PSpice.</p><p>
