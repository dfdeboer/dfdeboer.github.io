                   HOMEWORK STANDARDS</b><br>
            For Professor De Boer's Classes</p>

<P><B>Learn by Showing Others How</b><BR>
The overall goal of doing homework is to learn by showing how 
problems are solved.  You need to present a clear sequence of 
rational statements to show how a problem is solved, not simply 
a correct answer.</p><p> 

Skipped steps may be interpreted as a lack of understanding on 
your part and may be graded down accordingly. </p><p> 

If the answer is given, you must write something to show how you 
solved the problem.  (After all, you cannot expect credit for 
simply copying the answer!) Oftentimes you will use equations and 
math to show how you solved the problem, but sometimes you will 
need to explain how you solved the problem by using a sentence or 
two. </p><p>

                                                         <br><br>
<i>FOR LAB REPORTS</i><br>   
                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &mdash;Use letter size paper (about 8.5" x 11")<BR>
                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &mdash;Use unruled white paper as is typically used in a  <br> 
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   computer printer. <br>
                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &mdash;Engineering paper is completely prohibited.
                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   
   
                                                         <br></p><p>
<B>Staple</B><BR>
Staple in the upper left corner if there is more than one page. 
                                                      <BR></P><P>

<B>One Side Only</B><BR>
Write on only one side of each sheet of paper.  Do not write on 
the back side of the paper.  Exception:  Computer-printed pages 
may be printed on both sides in order to conserve paper. </P><P> 

<B>Use a Pencil</B><BR>
Most engineering problems include too much detail to hold in your 
head without writing intermediate steps down.  Thus you need to 
write in order to think.  But then mistakes happen because you 
started writing before thinking all the way through the problem.  
By using a pencil you can erase your mistakes.  Writing, 
thinking, writing more, erasing, re-writing, and so forth is the 
best and <i>fastest</i> way to solve engineering problems.   
Keeping a neat and easy-to-read page by erasing and re-writing is 
the right way to work.  Write a lot and when needed, 
erase.<p></p> 

A good quality 0.5&nbsp;mm mechanical pencil (e.g. Pentel brand 
or equivalent) and a good white plastic eraser (e.g. Pentel 
"Click") will pay for themselves many times over with time saved 
when used generously.  This equipment is available at the Dordt 
Bookstore and at other local merchants such as The Pencil Box and 
Walmart. </P><P> 

<B>Page Heading</B><BR>
Put the course number, problem set number, date, and your name at 
the top of each sheet of paper.  Example:                <BR><BR>
EGR 999
                         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
                         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
PS#99
                               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
9/9/99
                                                     &nbsp;&nbsp;
Van VanderVander</P><BR><P>

<B>Neat Page Layout</B><BR>
Write legibly.  Consider using white space to set off important 
parts of the problem or answers.  Boxes and underlining can also 
be helpful for the grader.  You may be graded down if the grader 
has difficulty deciphering what you have written or finding an 
answer. </P><P> 

<B>One Problem Per Page (usually)</B><BR>
Start each new problem at the top of a new page.  Exception: if 
the problem is short enough to finish it on the same page you 
started it.  If the problem takes more than one page, that is 
OK, you may continue on second and subsequent pages if needed, 
but <i>only if the problem started at the top of a new page</i>.  
You may be graded down for violating this rule.  </P><P> 

<B>Problem Summary Required</B><BR>
Start each problem with a summary of the problem statement.  As 
an alternative, you may photocopy the problem statement page, cut 
the problem statement out of the photocopy, and paste it onto 
your homework with a glue stick.</P><P>

<B>Units</B><BR>
When the problem statement includes units (seconds, volts, etc.) 
then the answer should include appropriate units. </P><P>

<B>Significant Digits, No Leading Decimals</B><BR>
Use an appropriate number of significant digits for your answers 
(often 3 digits unless the answer is obviously an integer 
quantity) and use engineering or scientific notation 
appropriately.  Do not allow leading decimals.  (Right: 0.125,    
Wrong: .125) </P><P>

<B>Graphs--Label Axes and Make 'em BIG</B><BR>
Graphs should be an appropriate size.  If the graph is an answer, 
this usually means at least two inches high and 3 inches wide.  
It is also necessary that the graph be appropriately scaled.  If 
you can cover the interesting area of the graph with your thumb, 
the graph is either too small or not scaled appropriately.  
<B>Title</B> the graph and <B>label both axes</B> with 
<B>quantity</B> and <B>units</B> where appropriate.  See Figure 1 
below.</P> 

           <P align="center"><IMG 
Src="../cd_common/HWSTD/graph.gif"><BR>
       <B>Figure 1.  An example of a properly labeled <BR>
              graph that is large enough.</B></P><P><BR>

<B>Proofs (Also "Show," "Explain," "Derive," Etc.)</B><BR>
You cannot convince most people by simply telling them the 
"correct answer."  People want to know more.  Sometimes we need 
proof.  Note:  Words like "show," "explain," "derive," etc. 
usually mean the same thing as "prove."<br><br> 

An engineering proof is a chain of statements leading from given 
information to a conclusion.  This chain of statements must be 
accompanied by the names of the relevant definitions, theorems, 
principles, and so forth.  (In a normal problem solution you only 
show the chain of statements, omitting the names and assuming the 
reader will recognize the definitions, theorems, etc. that have 
been used.)   <BR><BR> 

Engineering is about technical problems in a social context.  
Engineering is not simply applied math and science.  This means 
that an engineering proof needs to convince people by exposing a 
thought process which establishes the believed truth of some 
statement.  Generally, you cannot do a proof by computer because 
the computer does not expose the thought processes, it only gets 
"the right answer."  The "right answer" alone is not convincing.  
</P><P>                                

<B>Use of Calculators and Computers</B><BR>
Use calculators and computers appropriately to perform routine 
and tedious operations and calculations.  Computers are also 
ideal for producing clear and accurate graphs.</p><p> 

You may be graded down for using a calculator or computer to do a 
trivial operation.  For some examples, you should know how to do 
simple definite integrals without needing a calculator.  You 
should also know the sines and cosines of common angles such as 
cos(0) = 1, and you should know simple exponentials and logs such 
as exp(0) = 1 and ln(2<i>e</i>) = ln(2) + 1.  Relying on a 
calculator for these is about as rewarding as watching your friend 
play your favorite video game instead of learning to excel at 
the game yourself.</p><p> 

If you will not be allowed to use a calculator during the tests, 
consider doing some homework calculations entirely by hand so 
that you are prepared better for the tests.</P><P> 

Never use a computerized symbolic math program (e.g. the 
"symbolics" menu in MathCAD or the equivalent in your calculator) 
to do work that you don't know how to check.  Students who try 
this frequently get the answer wrong, have no way to realize the 
answer is wrong, and never learn how to solve the problem.  Even 
if the answer is in some technical mathematical sense correct, it 
might be in a useless form which betrays your ignorance.  
Example: <br><i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) = exp(<i>it</i>) + 
exp(&ndash;<i>it</i>) when a useful solution is 
<br><i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) = 2cos(<i>t</i>) Those expressions of 
<i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) are technically equivalent, but would you know 
what the first one means? </p><p> 

If you use a computer program (e.g. Mathcad) to help you solve a 
problem, you <i>must print the file and staple it to your 
homework</i>.  If you write a program (Matlab, Java, Visual 
Basic, etc.) print the source code (use a fixed pitch font such 
as "Courier New" if you have a choice) and print the output of 
the program too.  Missing a printout?  Credit may be denied! 
</P><P> 

If you use an unusual feature of your calculator, say an equation 
solver, definite integral solver, or matrix inverse operator, 
make a marginal note.  (e.g. "Used matrix inverse on my TI-89 
calculator.")  If you use such a feature repeatedly, you only 
need to note your method once, near the first instance. </p><P>

<B>Reference Books</B><BR>
If you use a table of integrals or trig. ID or a theorem or other 
such material from a reference book, you need to cite the source.  
(e.g. "Used table of integrals in calc. book by Edwards & Penny, 
4th edition."  Subsequent citations can be even shorter, e.g. 
"Integral Table.")  Since this is homework, a full citation (such 
as in IEEE or APA or MLA style) is not required so long as your 
classmates could reasonably find your source from the information 
given. </P><P>

                                              <a name="DYOW"></a>
<B>Do Your Own Work</B><BR>
This policy applies to the whole course, not just homework. 
In team situations (teams may be used in lab for example) the 
policy applies to the team rather than to an individual 
student.<br><br>

Presenting someone else's work as your own work is called 
<i>plagiarism</i>. Working from another student's paper, or from 
an e-mail or a computer file that essentially contains the 
solution, or using someone else's graded homework from a previous 
offering of the course are just a few ways to commit plagiarism.  
Professor De Boer also counts giving such information as 
plagiarism.  Keep your papers and computer files private.</p><p>

It is a good thing to <i>study</i> in a group.  It is also a good 
thing to hand in <i>original</i> work based on what <i>you 
learned</i> in a study group.  It is bad when you copy work from 
others in a group (a <i>copy</i> group?).  It is a very bad thing 
when there are deals made to use each other's work (e.g. "you do 
the even numbered problems, I'll do the odd numbered ones.") 
<P></P> 

Using the Internet or consulting friends to find resource 
materials to help you understand a subject so that you may solve 
a homework problem is acceptable, even laudable.  In contrast, 
using the Internet to find or purchase solutions to assigned 
work to copy (or "work") from, is plagiarism.<br><br>

Consider the value of <i>verbal</i> communications.  For example, 
saying, "You need to use such-and-such a theorem to solve that 
problem," is helpful.  "I think you made a math error because your 
method seems right," is another example of the right type of 
communication.  Even "I got five point nine one for the answer," 
is acceptable.  (Credit is given only for showing how to get the 
answer, not for the answer itself.)  Verbal communications are 
almost always constructive.</p><p> 

Consider the consequences of non-verbal communication. For 
example, giving your friend a copy of your notes to study 
from.  This means your friend did not take good notes and maybe 
does not know how to take good notes.  It would be better to 
force your friend to take notes or learn to take notes.  Showing 
papers or computer files or any other non-verbal communication 
can be unhelpful in the long run.  There are some legitimate 
exceptions, such as to help a friend who has been ill and could 
not attend class.<br><br> 

It is not OK to recite entire equations step-by-step leading to 
the solution.  It is not OK to show your friend your solution or 
a part of your solution.  If your friend is really stuck, you 
should probably refer him or her to the course instructor for 
help&mdash;that's what the instructor is here for after all.  If 
you desire more help than this rule allows, see the section 
below, "Help is Available."</P><P> 

The above is in addition to Dordt's policy on <A HREF= 
"http://www.dordt.edu/campus_life/student_handbook/general_information.shtml#academic_dishonesty" 
>Academic Dishonesty</A>*</p><p> 

Professor C.S. Lewis was once asked by another professor what he 
did about plagiarism.  Here is his advise, which Prof. De Boer 
thinks is insightful:  
<blockquote>
   I told him I was not a detective nor even a schoolmaster, nor 
   a nurse, and that I absolutely refused to take any precaution 
   against this puerile trick; that I'd as soon think it my 
   business to see that he washed behind his ears or wiped his 
   bottom.  He... [dropped out] of his own accord the next week 
   and I never saw him again.  I think you ought to make a 
   general announcement of that sort....  It is bad for them to 
   think this is "up to you."  Flay them alive if you 
   <i>happen</i> to detect them; but don't let them feel that you 
   are a safeguard against the effects of their own idleness.<br> 
       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What staggers me is how any man can 
   prefer the galley-slave labour of transcription* to the 
   freeman's work of attempting [the assignment] on his 
   own.<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<B>Lateness Policy</B><br>
Professor De Boer handles each instance of late work (any kind
of lateness including missed tests) on a case-by-case basis.  
Generally speaking, missed tests will not be rescheduled, even 
in the case of illness.  Professor De Boer will work with 
you to come to some fair resolution of the matter that is 
respectful of our time and circumstances.  If you know 
something will be late or know that you cannot take a test on 
schedule, discuss this with Professor De Boer before the due 
date or test date or as soon afterward as is practical.<br><br>

If your work is late, Professor De Boer would still like you 
to do it, and you may still hand it in.  However, you will 
have to depend on professor De Boer's judgement of how to 
grade your late work.  Some factors that work to your benefit 
are: <br><br>

&mdash;A semester-long record of otherwise on-time work.<br>
&mdash;Turning the work in before solutions are posted.<br>
&mdash;Giving notice before the due date or test date.<br>
&mdash;The reason for the lateness.<br>
&mdash;Evidence you may bring to support your credibility.<br>
&mdash;The trend of your class and lab attendance and punctuality.<br>
&mdash;Your grades on other work in the course (see next paragraph). <br><br>

Often Professor De Boer will hold work turned in late until 
the end of the semester (the usual practice), but he might 
grade it anytime before that.  At the end of the semester 
Professor De Boer will review your grades and look for zeros 
that are the consequence of late work not yet graded.  He 
will <i>temporarily</i> change these zero grades to perfect 
grades.  If this change did not change the course grade, 
Professor De Boer will return the grades on the late work 
to zero and leave the late work ungraded.  If the course
grade was changed, Professor De Boer will <i>consider</i> 
grading the held work and giving partial or full credit 
or he might just restore the original "zero" for the late 
work.  Using your other grades in the course as a basis, 
Professor De Boer reserves the right to estimate a grade 
for late work without reading the work, or to grade late 
work on any other basis that he deems fitting to the 
circumstances.<br><br>

<b>Help is Available</b><br>
For occasional help, you may call or visit Professor De Boer at 
his office (722-6245) during the daytimes.  You may also call him 
at home Monday through Saturday before 10 PM 
(<img 
src="../cd_common/HWSTD/home_ph.gif">).  
</p><p> 

If you need (or want) help more frequently, consult the secretary 
at the ASK center and request "peer tutoring." (Or fill in an 
online form to make the request, see <a 
href="https://denis.dordt.edu/offices/ask_center/">this 
page</a>** and click on the "Peer Tutoring" link in the left 
panel to get started.) Professor De Boer believes that the grade 
of most any student can be improved by about a half or a full 
letter grade simply by routine participation in the tutorial 
services of the ASK center.</p><p> 

Tutorial help is available for many 100 and 200 numbered courses 
at Dordt College, and for some other courses too, so <a 
href="https://denis.dordt.edu/offices/ask_center/">ASK!</a>**  
When tutorial help is offered for a class, any student in the 
class may participate.  The ASK center is located in the lower 
level of the library.<br><br>
