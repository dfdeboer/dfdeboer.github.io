<b>Further description of the optional 3rd Monday assignment</b></p><p>
 
  <i>Optional, for up to 10 points of extra credit
  applied to your homework grade:</i><br><br>
 
  On Monday, 2/21, at 11:00 AM, in room S108,
  attend the "Third Monday&mdash;Engineering Panel"
  disscussion on the topic of engineering jobs.
  Then write up a reflection essay of between 500
  and 1000 words. Submit your essay
  electronically as an MS-Word file in doc or
  docx format. The link to submit is near the
  very end of the EGR 204 courses@dordt page.
  Your essay must be submitted before class on
  Wednesday, 2/23. You must be present and on
  time at the event in S108 for your essay to
  qualify. Here are some suggestions for what to
  write about in your reflective essay:<br><br>
 
  Which of the panelists was most relevant to
  your situation and why? What did you learn
  that you did not already know and how will you
  respond to this new knowledge? Did Dordt's
  Dordt's engineering degree prepare the
  panelists for their careers in the ways you
  expected? Will it be as easy (or hard) for you
  to find a job as it was for the panelists?
  Pick one question or devise your own question
  and write an essay in response. The essay
  should not repeat the question but should state
  your response in a thesis sentence and defend
  the thesis with sentences and paragraphs
