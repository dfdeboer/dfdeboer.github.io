                       PEER GRADING RUBRIC
                       -------------------

The purposes of peer grading are to. . .
    (1) provide motivation for keeping up with the course, and
    (2) to help each other learn how to solve problems, and
    (3) to learn how to communicate our findings to others.


This is the Rubric:
-------------------
"A" The work shows a sincere effort.  The presentation of the
    work shows how the problem was solved.  I can read it without
    difficulty.  (Correctness is not required.)

"B" The work shows a sincere effort but is incomplete.  Or, the
    work does not show all of what I would like to know about how
    the problem was solved.  Or, the work is hard to read, but
    mostly readable with effort.

"C" Something is there and some sincere effort is shown.

"D" (This grade is not allowed)

"F" Nothing of substance is there.  The student would have no 
    basis upon which to participate in class discussion.  

Plus and minus grades are not allowed.  Comments from the peer
grader to the student being graded are encouraged.  Please write
them on the back of the page or in the margin so that the student
may correct mistakes without re-copying the work.

Peer grading will be weighted as one quarter of the total 
homework grade.  For example, if the homework is 10% of the total 
course grade, then peer grading is 2.5% of the total course grade 
and the grades from the final grading of the homework are 7.5% of 
the total course grade.
