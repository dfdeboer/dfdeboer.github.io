<H2>Grading Part Two of the Research Paper</H2>

<P><B>"A"</B><BR>
--All deficiencies in the thesis statement and references have 
been fixed.  (See the grading rubric for part one and your graded 
copy of part one.)  <BR><BR>
--The outline includes an introduction and a conclusion each of 
which contain content as specified in the booklet "<a href=
"http://courses.dordt.edu/file.php/418/F10/LAB/LRF09.PDF"
>How to Write a Lab Report</a>."  <BR><BR>
--The outline clearly shows the major headings you will use and 
it shows how the thesis will be defended and how the 
references will be used.  <BR><BR>
--The reference list and the citations that call the reader's 
attention to your reference list are in IEEE style.  Citations
are made with braces such as "[1]." (not superscripts, etc.)  The
reference list is in the order of citation (not alphabetical).
See the booklet "<a href=
"http://courses.dordt.edu/file.php/418/F10/LAB/LRF09.PDF"
>How to Write a Laboratory Report</a>" pages 22 through 24 for more
details and for examples.   

<BR><P><B>"B"</B><BR>
--The reference list includes at least two books or peer reviewed 
sources and has at least five independent sources.  The count
of two books or peer reviewed articles does not count 
encyclopedias, anthologies, or your course textbook.  <br><br>
--One or two of these problems still remain:  Thesis still does not 
meet the specification of part one.  Outline does not show how the 
thesis will be defended.  Outline does not show how the 
references will be used. Reference list is far from IEEE style.</P> 

<BR><P><B>"C"</B><BR>
More than two of the problems described above although a good-
faith effort shows. --OR-- inadequate references showing 
insufficient improvement from part one.</P> 

<BR><P><B>"D"</B><BR>
(This grade will not be given.)</P>

<BR><P><B>"F"</B><BR>
Anything less than a "C"</P>

(Evidence for "Good faith" effort includes the logical 
relationships between elements of the outline, showing 
thought and consideration of the subject and supporting the 
thesis.) </P>
