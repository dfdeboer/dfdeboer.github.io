<H2>Example One</H2>

<P>The RS-232 serial communication standard was the forerunner 
of all modern serial communication standards.</P>

<P><font color="red">This thesis has no real element of controversy, 
therefore it is not a good thesis.  Assuming a good bibliography, 
the grade is "C."  Without a bibliography the grade is 
"F."</font></P><BR> 



<H2>Example Two</H2>

<P>The RS-232 serial communication standard has found enduring
applications for over 50 years because it is not highly detailed.
</P>

<P><font color="red">This thesis is marginally workable.  
(Grade is "B.")  
The author needs to show how the application of the standard 
evolved over time and how that evolution depended on the 
exploitation of the standard's lack of detail.  A weakness of 
the thesis is that it deals only indirectly, if at all, with 
the contribution of the RS-232 standard to culture.  The 
thesis could be made stronger by changing it to 
</font> "The RS-232 serial communication standard has found 
creative culture-changing applications for over 50 years because 
it is not highly detailed."</P><BR> 


<H2>Example Three</H2>

<P>There is an interesting tradeoff in the creation of standards
between the specificity of the standard and the ability to 
creatively use the standard in unanticipated settings as times
(cultures) change.
The RS-232 and the IEEE-488 communication standards are two 
contrasting examples.</P> 

<P><font color="red">This is good thesis.  (Grade is "A.")  There 
is a need to keep the scope of the paper limited to just 
supporting this thesis, otherwise the paper could become too 
diffuse by meandering through too many technical details of each 
standard.  The paper needs to establish the contrasts between
how the applications of the two standards evolved or failed to
evolve in culture, and it needs to show how these depended on the 
degree of specificity of the standard.  </font></P><BR>
