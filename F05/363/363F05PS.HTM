|  |       |       |       | plots.)  (On 10/19, after          |
|  |       |       |       | discussion in class, the due date  |
|  |       |       |       | was changed from 10/19 to 10/21.)  |

|  |       |       |       | 2.46.1, 2.46.2 Note: The answer    |
|  |       |       |       | to 2.46.2 should be expressed using|
|  |       |       |       | the sinc() and cos() functions, not|
|  |       |       |       | just a long sum of complex         |
|  |       |       |       | exponentials.                      |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Hint:  Both 2.46.1 and 2.46.2 can  |
|  |       |       |       | be done by applying the analysis   |
|  |       |       |       | equation directly to x(t) but it   |
|  |       |       |       | is easier to use properties (time  |
|  |       |       |       | shift, linearity, etc.) and the    |
|  |       |       |       | table on page 81 of the text.      |

Note 1) If a "#" follows the "returned" date, then the solution
key is posted on the cork board across the hall from room S233.

Note 2) Problems sets shown above with no "assigned" date are 
tentative.  More problems might be added, expected due dates 
might change, but problems shown will eventually be assigned.
