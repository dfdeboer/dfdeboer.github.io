<H2>Grading Part One of the Research Paper</H2>

<P><B>"A"</B><BR>
Thesis statement has a limited and manageable scope.  It 
is no more than three sentences and no more than 100 
words.  It also expresses a specific and legitimately 
debatable point-of-view.  The paper will either defend 
that point-of-view or present an analysis of the point-of-
view, describing the conditions under which it is likely 
to succeed best and the opposing points-of-view. </P>

<P>Your thesis statement must meet the guidelines found in
either The College Writer or Write for College.  In The 
College Writer see pages 41, 446ff, 450.  Equivalently, in 
Write for College, see 024, 111, 113, 287, and 288. </P>

<P>The thesis is grammatically correct.</P>

<P)The bibliography contains at least two good books or 
peer-reviewed sources and at least five sources over-all.  At 
least two peer-reviewed sources and five sources over-all are 
independent of each other.  (Examples of non-independent 
sources are two sources by the same author.) </P>

<P>The bibliography requirements are met (at least 2 books or 
peer reviewed sources, 5 sources total).

<P>The annotations for each source show clearly the essential
content of the source that is relevant to your thesis and how
you will use the source to support your thesis.</P>


<BR><P><B>"B"</B><BR>
The bibliography requirements are met.  One or a few other 
requirements are not met in full. </P>

<BR><P><B>"C"</B><BR>
No more than one of these problems:  Serious problems with 
the thesis, although a good-faith effort shows. --OR-- 
inadequate bibliography. </P>

<BR><P><B>"D"</B><BR>
(This grade will not be given.)</P>

<BR><P><B>"F"</B><BR>
Anything less than a "C"</P>

(Evidence for "Good faith" effort includes the logical 
relationships between elements of the outline, showing 
thought and consideration of the subject and supporting the 
thesis.) </P>
