|  |       |       |       | date was delayed two days due to a |

|  |       |       |       | Note: for Ex 1 through 4 you may   |
|  |       |       |       | use the dfield solver (linked from |
|  |       |       |       | the course web page.)  Point the   |
|  |       |       |       | mouse at your guess for an initial |
|  |       |       |       | condition.  Before clicking, write |
|  |       |       |       | down the initial condition as      |
|  |       |       |       | reported in the lower left corner  |
|  |       |       |       | of the window.  Print the resulting|
|  |       |       |       | graph showing your best efforts.   |
|  |       |       |       | Copy the initial conditions on the |
|  |       |       |       | printout as labels on the resulting|
|  |       |       |       | solutions.  Print the page showing |
|  |       |       |       | your best results and turn that in.|
|  |       |       |       | Anything close gets full credit.   |
|  |       |       |       | Repeat for  Ex 5-8.                |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | A further note:  To get credit,    |
|  |       |       |       | your plot must show dots where the |
|  |       |       |       | solutions cross t = 0 (these are   |
|  |       |       |       | the places where you clicked your  |
|  |       |       |       | mouse) and no other dots.          |
|  |       |       |       | Alternatively you may set the      |
|  |       |       |       | initial conditions from the        |
|  |       |       |       | keyboard.  On the Direction Field  |
|  |       |       |       | plot, from the top menu select     |
|  |       |       |       | "Solution | Keyboard input of      |
|  |       |       |       | initial value."  (Keyboard         |
|  |       |       |       | instructions were added on 10/19.) |

|  |       |       |       | Hint:  The bigger you make the     |
|  |       |       |       | the graphs, the easier it is to    |
|  |       |       |       | work with.                         |

|  |       |  8/29 |  8/31#| Hint on #10:  The motion is one-   |
|  |       |       |       | dimensional.  When the displacement|
|  |       |       |       | is positive the force needs to be  |
|  |       |       |       | negative and when the displacement |
|  |       |       |       | is negative the force needs to be  |
|  |       |       |       | positive.  This is what, "...but   |
|  |       |       |       | opposite..." means in the problem  |
|  |       |       |       | statement.  See also the <A

final grade on the second listed due date.  Peer grading will be 
1/5 (20%) of the homework grade.

Note 2) If a "#" follows the "returned" date, then the solution
key is posted on the cork board across the hall from room S233.

Note 3) Problems sets shown above with no "assigned" date are 
tentative.  More problems might be added, expected due dates 
might change, but problems shown will eventually be assigned.
