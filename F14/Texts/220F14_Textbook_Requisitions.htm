<div class="title">Thank you!  Below is what you submitted to the Bookstore:</div>
<p><strong>EGR-220-01: Linear Circuits</strong></p>
<p>If new editions become available before classes start, would you like to use the new editions?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>If yes, are you aware if a new edition is currently available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will the students enrolling in this course already have the textbook from a previous course that they themselves have taken?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong></strong></p>
<p>Do you require a CD or access code, if one is available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will you be advising the students that they <strong>NEED</strong> to have their own textbook, that they may share a particular textbook, that they really don't need the textbook, or any other options you might share with the students?  <em>We would appreciate knowing this so that we can make a more responsible order decision on how many textbooks to order.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>The textbook is required for all students in EGR 220. This course will be peer graded. For this reason, every student needs simultaneous access to the textbook. Each student should personally have a textbook in the classroom.</strong></p>

<p><p>Only NCEES approved calculators will be allowed for use during tests and the final exam. The NCEES list of approved calculators can be found here: <a href="http://ncees.org/exams/calculator-policy/">http://ncees.org/exams/calculator-policy/</a> A calculator with support for complex numbers (E.g. the "TI-36X Pro," or the Casio "fx-115ES PLUS" or the "HP 35S") are especially useful for this course. Complex numbers will be used in the last third of this course. More about the Engineering Department's calculator policy can be found here: <a href="http://blogs.dordt.edu/ddeboer/2012/05/30/what-calculator-is-best-for-engineering/">http://blogs.dordt.edu/ddeboer/2012/05/30/what-calculator-is-best-for-engineering/</a><br><br>

Professor De Boer will not be using the latest edition of the textbook. The latest edition is the 5th edition, but Prof. De Boer will use the 4th edition. The 5th edition is almost exactly page-for-page the same as the less expensive fourth edition. Purchase only the 4th edition! This textbook is also available directly from the publisher in electronic format. See <a href="http://www.coursesmart.com/fundamentals-of-electric-circuits-4th-edition/alexander-charles-sadiku-matthew/dp/0077272366">http://www.coursesmart.com/fundamentals-of-electric-circuits-4th-edition/alexander-charles-sadiku-matthew/dp/0077272366</a> but beware that the "free trial" offered there will not get students through the course. Professor De Boer believes that to date, no students have used the electronic version in his course. (Used textbooks are much less expensive than the electronic version, and they don't "expire.")</p></p>
