               POWER STEERING (AND MORE)          <BR></b></p><p>
A power steering system is essentially an op-amp made of gears, 
levers, shafts, and hydraulics.  You can learn how a simple 
old-fashioned drag-link power steering system works from this 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlpvyWAA8a0&feature=fvwp"
                                    >video</a>. It is a bit old but 
it's pretty good! Its simplicity makes it easier to understand.</p><p>

The goal of the power cylinder and control valve is to keep the
steering shaft near the center of it's up-down travel.  The power
cylinder and control valve is not literally an operational 
amplifier, but there are similarities.<p></p>

Drag-link steering systems are now obsolete and considered 
dangerous.  If you get in an accident that bends the drag link 
or the vehicle's frame relative to the drag link, you will 
lose control of the steering, even if the car is not
badly smashed up.  Modern cars use a <a href=
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9ISZYf1Hfw">rack-and-pinion</a> system
like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Steer_system.jpg"
>this</a>. Hydraulic power steering can be added like 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTiOhcRd5EI"
>this</a>.  But that's also getting old-fashioned.  How about electric, "<a href=
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECUoL5SpOoE"
>servo-tronic</a>" (marketing hype--but the product is real) 
power steering!  </p><p>

Electrical and electronic systems are becoming more economically
competitive than mechanical and hydraulic systems.  There will 
always be a need for some mechanical parts (wheels, bearings,
are examples) but internal parts are being replaced with electrical
parts for lower costs and better performance.  Most new cars sold 
in the last year or so now have <a href=

>electric power steering</a>.<p></p>

Modern electric 
power steering assist systems are coupled with the electronic 
stability control system.  If a dangerous steering event is detected
by the computer, say cornering so hard as to encourage a roll-over,
then the amount of steering assist is instantly reduced by a measured
amount to discourage the driver from turning that sharply.  Such
refinements would be much more expensive to accomplish with 
hydraulic power steering.</p><p>

You can even take it further and 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-rxJkVzUxI">let 
the car park itself</a>.  Shoot, pretty soon 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nYhKD8leAg"
>cars will drive themselves</a>.  What an exciting time to be
an engineer!  Think of the cultural issues these possiblities
present us.  How about a self-driving school bus with no 
driver on board?  That is possible with today's technology.</p><p>

Guess what?  Op-amps, the real genuine electronic kind, are 
essential for this technology.</p><p>
