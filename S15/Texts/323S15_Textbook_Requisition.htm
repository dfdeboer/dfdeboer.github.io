<div class="title">Thank you!  Below is what you submitted to the Bookstore:</div>
<p><strong>EGR-323-01: Electronics II</strong></p>
<p>If new editions become available before classes start, would you like to use the new editions?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>If yes, are you aware if a new edition is currently available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will the students enrolling in this course already have the textbook from a previous course that they themselves have taken?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">If so, from which course? <strong>EGR 322, Electronics I</strong></p>
<p>Do you require a CD or access code, if one is available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will you be advising the students that they <strong>NEED</strong> to have their own textbook, that they may share a particular textbook, that they really don't need the textbook, or any other options you might share with the students?  <em>We would appreciate knowing this so that we can make a more responsible order decision on how many textbooks to order.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Some tests and the final exam in this course will be "open book." Each student will simultaneously need access to a textbook. Textbooks may not be shared during a test or during the final exam. Each student should personally bring a textbook to each class.</strong></p>

<div class="header2">Comments:</div>
<p>A new texbook includes a DVD. In a used textbook the DVD is not required but is desirable as a convenience. Contents of the DVD: <br>
***** Cadence PSpice v16.2 Demo Software. A newer version is available free as "OrCAD PCB Designer Lite" also known as "OrCAD 16.6 Demo Software (Capture and PSpice only)." For details see <a href="http://homepages.dordt.edu/ddeboer/F14/322/PSPICE.htm">http://homepages.dordt.edu/ddeboer/F14/322/PSPICE.htm</a><br>
***** National Instruments Multisim v10.1.1 Student Edition <br>
***** Lab-on-a-disk SPICE Simulations (also available on "Canvas") <br>
***** Bonus Text Topics (also available on "Canvas") <br>
***** Text Appendices (also available on "Canvas") <br>
***** Link to Sedra/Smith Website (also available on "Canvas"). <br><br>

For access to the content on "Canvas" you must be enrolled in the course. <br><br>

The one item on the DVD not available without the DVD and the textbook is the NI "Multisim Student Edition." However the Multisim software is not used at Dordt (we use the PSpice software). The similar NI "Multisim Academic Evaluation" 30-day trial is available free on the web at http://www.ni.com/multisim/try/ . The version included on the DVD with the textbook requires Windows Vista, Windows XP, or Windows 2000 SP3 or later, 32 bit versions only. Specifically, Multisim Student Edition 10.1 (on the DVD) is not specifically supported on Windows 7.<br><br>

Students may only use an NCEES approved calculator for tests and the final exam. The approved list can be found here: <a href="http://www.ncees.org/exams/calculator-policy">http://www.ncees.org/exams/calculator-policy</a> Complex number calculations are needed in 
this course. Thus a calculator model that can do complex number calculations is advantagious.  The TI-36x Pro, Casio FX-115 ES, and HP 35s can do 
complex number calculations.</p>
