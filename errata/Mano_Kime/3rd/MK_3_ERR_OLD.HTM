   not "F."  (Change the second "F" to a "G".) (Posted 1/20/06)

p138-9, Problems 3-24, 3-25.  The publisher's errata (see link 
   above) is not sufficient to correct all the errors students 
   encounter when working this problem.  Instead of referring 
   to Figure 4-10, Students should use the datasheet for the 
   type '139 2-to-4 decoder, for example the one from <A 
   HREF="http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/74%2F74F139.pdf"
   >Fairchild</A>
   <A HREF="http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/74%2F74F139.pdf"
   >Semiconductor</A>.  Note that O  = D ,   O  = D , etc.

   Also note that the truth tables given in datasheets typically 
                            _
   refer to signals such as O .  (Notice the bar for negation.)  
                             1
   That is the signal present on the wire that connects outside 

   the bubble--that is the pin of the chip.  

   The use of "bubbles" for negation in Figure 3-34 is 
   inconsistent with Figure 4-10.  Figure 4-10 does not correctly 
   describe the decoders used on Figure 3-34.  (To modify Figure 
   4-10, for use with these problems only, each of the four AND 
   gates at the outputs should be NAND gates.  Also, there should 
   be a third inverter located on the schematic above the 
   existing two inverters and in the EN signal line.  Finally, in 
   the truth table to Figure 4-10, in each of the columns EN, D0, 
   D1, D2, and D3, replace each "1" with a "0" and vice versa.  
   The modified figure is useful only for these two problems 
   however.) (Updated 1/25/06.)

   the problem statement since the answer to this problem is 
   posted on the book's companion web site.  In the PDF file with

   label "4-10.*" to "4-8*."  Underneath the schematic diagram 
   add a horizontal line.  Just under the horizontal line, add 
   the label "4-10.*" (The solution to 4-8 is only the 
   schematic.)

   web site is improperly labeled and is also incomplete.  
   
   CORRECT THE LABELS:  The on the PDF file for this answer, 
   change the label "4-10.*" to 4-8.*".  Below the schematic 
   diagram and above the truth table and K-maps, add a horizontal 
   line.  Just below this horizontal line add the label "4-10*".  

   THE ANSWER SHOWN FOR 4-10* IS INCOMPLETE:  Students' 
   solutions must also include a gate-level schematic of the 
   logic.  This part of the answer is not given in the PDF file.

   unsigned binary.  Pad each with zeros until they are each 8-
   bits wide.  2) Negate subtrahends by taking the 2's 
   complement.  3)  Add.  4)  For each case, note "overflow" or 
   "no overflow" as the case may be. 

   (Several of the given unsigned numbers are too large in 
   magnitude to properly represent as signed integers with the 
   same number of bits.  That "correct" answers can be obtained 
   in these instances by using the methods shown in some 
   examples in the textoobk is only because people can interpret 
   the bits in the context of a modular number system.  Digital 
   hardware does not act like that.  The four-step method 
   described above emulates what 8-bit digital hadware would do 
   to add the numbers.)

   students:  The absence of a name in the block diagram symbol, 
   along with no postponement symbols or dynamic symbol, implies 
   a latch.  Postponement or dynamic symbols are used to imply a 
   master-slave or edge-triggered flip-flop, as shown in Figure
