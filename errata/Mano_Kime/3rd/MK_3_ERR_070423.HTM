   The publisher's errata (see link above) is not sufficient  
   guidance for students.   Students should use the datasheet 
   and truth table for the type '139 2-to-4 decoder, for example 
   the one from <A HREF= 
   "http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/74%2F74F139.pdf" >Fairchild 
   Semiconductor</A> (shows symbols similar to Figure 3-34) or 
   <A HREF="http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74als139.pdf"
   >Texas Instruments</A> (Page 2 of this datasheet has a 
   complete schematic at the gate level of the two  2-to-4 
   decoders shown in Figure 3-34, including the "bubbles.") to 
   decipher the logical function of a 2-to-4 decoder.  <br><br> 

   Note that <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>  = <i>O</i><sub>1</sub>  = 
   <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>, &nbsp; 
   <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>  = <i>O</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>D</i><sub>2</sub>, &nbsp;etc.
                                                         <br><br>

   Also note that the truth tables given in datasheets typically 
   refer to signals such as <img src="O_bar.gif"><sub>1</sub>.  
   (Notice the overbar for negation.) That label refers to the 
   signal present on the wire that connects outside the 
   bubble&#8212;in other words, it is the label for the pin of 
   the chip.  The same label, when it is shown inside the 
   schematic box representing the function of the chip does not 
   include the overbar but there will be a bubble or arrow symbol 
   on the output line in place of the overbar. <br><br> 

   <blockquote><small>
   (<i>Further detail:</i>  Since students have typically not yet 
   studied decoders, they refer to the index and typically zero 
   in on Figure 4-10.  But the use of "bubbles" for negation in 
   Figure 3-34 makes Figure 4-10 nearly impossible for students 
   to apply correctly since it is not literally the gate-level 
   circuit for each decoder in Figure 3-34.  Instead of looking 
   at Figure 4-10 at this time, students learn better if they 
   consult an actual datasheet.)</small></blockquote>

   Add these instructions for working the problem. . . <br>
   <blockquote>
       Work the problem in this order:  <br><br>
   
       1)  The given numbers are unsigned binary.  Pad each with 
           zeros until <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they 
           are each 8-bits wide.  <br><br> 
   
       2)  Negate subtrahends by taking the 2's complement.  <br><br>
       
       3)  Add.  <br><br>
       
       4)  For each case, note "overflow" or "no overflow" as 
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the case may be. <br><br>

   <small>
   (Several of the given unsigned numbers are too large in 
   magnitude to properly represent as signed integers with the 
   same number of bits.  That "correct" answers can be obtained 
   in these instances by using the methods shown in some 
   examples in the textbook is only because people can interpret 
   the bits in the context of a modular number system.  Digital 
   hardware does not act like that.  The four-step method 
   described above emulates what 8-bit digital hardware would do 
   to add the numbers.)

   <i>A note to students on block symbols</i>:  The absence of a 
   name in the block diagram symbol, along with no postponement 
   symbols or dynamic symbol, implies a latch.  Postponement or 
   dynamic symbols are used to imply a master-slave or edge-
   triggered flip-flop, as shown in Figure 6-14 and described on

        Line 9.  (starts with "shifting two's") Replace the word
