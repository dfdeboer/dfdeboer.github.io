If you are considering purchasing this textbook and worrying that 
it is a poor choice due to the length of this list of errata, please
reconsider.  Competing textbooks have about as many errata, but perhaps
no list like this.  "Better the devil you know than the devil you don't." 
Professor De Boer likes this book enough to find it worthwhile
to publish this list of errata.                    </small></p><br>

Page 34, Problem 1-10.</b><br>
   The answers given online at the publisher's web site have 
   errors of precision.   Correct answers are:<br>
   a.)  16612<b><font size=+1>.</font></b>346<sub>&nbsp;8</sub><br>
   b.)  792<b><font size=+1>.</font></b>41D<sub>16</sub>&nbsp;<br>
   c.)  1010 1111<b><font size=+1>.</font></b>0010 1100 11<sub>2</sub>
   <blockquote>In part (a) the original number, 7562.45 base ten, 
   has significance down to the 1/100’s place.  It would be 
   desirable to convert the number maintaining at least that 
   much accuracy, but not signifying much more.  In octal one can 
   round to the 1/8’s place, 1/64’s place, 1/512 place, 1/4096 
   place etc.  Rounding to the 1/512’s place seems an appropriate 
   choice compared to the original 1/100’s place accuracy.  That 
   will preserve all the given significant digits and not signify 
   too much additional precision.  Since 512 = 8<sup>3</sup> this means I 
   should round to three digits to the right of the radix point.  
   The textbook’s answer rounds to the nearest 1/4096’s place.  
   The original number does not have that much place 
   significance.  Thus 16612.346 octal is a more reasonable answer.
   <br><br>The rationale for parts (b) and (c) is the same, 
   only the bases are changed.

   In the problem statement, change the word "unsigned" to 
   "signed."  Note that when you "obtain" 
   the complement you negate the number.<BR><BR>

   In the solution posted on the web for this problem, again 
   change the word "unsigned" to "signed."
                                            <blockquote><small> 

     (The problem statement as given is ambiguous.  "Obtain" 
     could be construed to mean converting unsigned numbers into
     a signed representation by adding a leading zero as a 
     positive sign.  The other way to construe the problem 
     statement is to negate the given number by finding the 
     complement as described in the text on pages 157 and 158.  
     This was the author's intent.  For students this is an 
     unexpected maneuver.  They wonder how one can negate an 
     unsigned number, or why one would do this&mdash;although 
     there are valid reasons.  Simply stating that the given 
     numbers are already signed clears up the confusion.)<br>

   No errata, however hard drives with rotating parts and "cylinder, 
   head, sector" (CHS) addressing are obsolete for new products.<br>
   The coverage here is also very simplified (which is appropriate for this
   context).  For more detailed information about hard drives with rotating 
   parts one may read about <a href=
   "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_bit_recording">zoned recording</a> and 
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_block_addressing"

   are now common.  You can read about <a href=
