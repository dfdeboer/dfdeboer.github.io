   In the problem statement, change the word "unsigned" to

   the complement you negate the number.<BR><BR>

   In the solution posted on the web for this problem, again

     (The problem statement as given is ambiguous.  "Obtain" 
     could be construed to mean converting unsigned numbers into
     a signed representation by adding a leading zero as a 
     positive sign.  The other way to construe the problem 
     statement is to negate the given number by finding the 
     complement as described in the text on pages 157 and 158.  
     This was the author's intent.  For students this is an 
     unexpected maneuver.  They wonder how one can negate an 
     unsigned number, or why one would do this&mdash;although 
     there are valid reasons.  Simply stating that the given 
     numbers are already signed clears up the confusion.)

   The example of a 750 GB drive is not appropriate to the 
   preceding discussion.  Instead of using cylinder, head, sector 
   addressing (CHS addressing) as the text describes and as 
   Figure 12-2 illustrates, large hard disks use logical block 
   addressing (LBA).  Replace Example 12-1 in the text with the 
   following two examples.  Example 12-1 then is suitable to the 
   text's discussion of CHS addressing

   heads.  There are 512 bytes per sector and 63 sectors per
