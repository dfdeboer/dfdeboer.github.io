   The answer given online at the publisher's web site has an 
   error in it.  The error is in the answer for the p.o.s. form 
   in part (b).  The correct answer is <IMG SRC="MK3_P93.GIF"> 
   (the same as the s.o.p. form.)

Page 138-9, Problems 3-24, 3-25.</b><br>
   The publisher's errata (see link above) is not sufficient  
   guidance for students.   Students should use the datasheet 
   and truth table for the type '139 2-to-4 decoder, for example 
   the one from <A HREF= 
   "http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/74%2F74F139.pdf" >Fairchild 
   Semiconductor</A> (shows symbols similar to Figure 3-34) or 
   <A HREF="http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74als139.pdf"
   >Texas Instruments</A> (Page 2 of this datasheet has a 
   complete schematic at the gate level of the two  2-to-4 
   decoders shown in Figure 3-34, including the "bubbles.") to 
   decipher the logical function of a 2-to-4 decoder.  <br><br> 

   Note that <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>  = <i>O</i><sub>1</sub>  = 
   <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>, &nbsp; 
   <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>  = <i>O</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>D</i><sub>2</sub>, &nbsp;etc.
                                                         <br><br>

   Also note that the truth tables given in datasheets typically 
   refer to signals such as <img src="O_bar.gif"><sub>1</sub>.  
   (Notice the overbar for negation.) That label refers to the 
   signal present on the wire that connects outside the 
   bubble&#8212;in other words, it is the label for the pin of 
   the chip.  The same label, when it is shown inside the 
   schematic box representing the function of the chip does not 
   include the overbar but there will be a bubble or arrow symbol 
   on the output line in place of the overbar. <br><br> 

   <blockquote><small>
   (<i>Further detail:</i>  Since students have typically not yet 
   studied decoders, they refer to the index and typically zero 
   in on Figure 4-10.  But the use of "bubbles" for negation in 
   Figure 3-34 makes Figure 4-10 nearly impossible for students 
   to apply correctly since it is not literally the gate-level 
   circuit for each decoder in Figure 3-34.  Instead of looking 
   at Figure 4-10 at this time, students learn better if they 
   consult an actual datasheet.)</small></blockquote>
