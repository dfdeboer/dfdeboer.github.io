Page 197, Problem 4-3.</b><br>
   In the problem statement, change the word "unsigned" to 
   "signed."  Note that when you "obtain" 
   the complement you negate the number.<BR><BR>

   In the solution posted on the web for this problem, again 
   change the word "unsigned" to "signed."
                                            <blockquote><small> 

     (The problem statement as given is ambiguous.  "Obtain" 
     could be construed to mean converting unsigned numbers into
     a signed representation by adding a leading zero as a 
     positive sign.  The other way to construe the problem 
     statement is to negate the given number by finding the 
     complement as described in the text on pages 157 and 158.  
     This was the author's intent.  For students this is an 
     unexpected maneuver.  They wonder how one can negate an 
     unsigned number, or why one would do this.  Simply stating 
     that the given numbers are already signed clears up the 
     matter.) </small></blockquote>

   1.) Remove the arc that leads from S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>.
   <br>Also remove the label associated with that arc.  <br><br>

   2.) Change the label on the arc that leads from S<sub>1</sub> 
   to S<sub>2</sub> from <br>"01/11" to "01/11, 11/00".<br><br>

   3.) On all three arcs which lead <i>out</i> of S<sub>3</sub> 
   change the outputs from "/01" to "/11".<br><br>
