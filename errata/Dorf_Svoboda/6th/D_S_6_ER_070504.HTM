                         ---------------                 5/04/07)
                         Dorf & Svoboda, 
            Introduction to Electric Circuits, 6th Ed. 
                 ISBN 0-471-44795-1, Wiley, 2004.

                  (<A HREF="../7th/D_S_7_ER.HTM">errata for 7th edition here</A>)

First, see the author's list at 
   <A HREF="http://www.clarkson.edu/~svoboda/errata/6th.html">http://www.clarkson.edu/~svoboda/errata/6th.html</A>

In addition, there are the following errata:
                                              <A NAME=ERR_56></A>
Page 56.  Problem DP2-3, add 2 W, 5 W, and 10 W as available 
   power ratings.
                                              <A NAME=ERR_63></A>
Page 63.  Seven printed lines from the bottom of the page change 
   "KCL" to "KVL."  The affected sentence then begins:  "The KVL 
   equation for this loop of Figure 3.3-1c is. . ." 
                                             <A NAME=ERR_168></A>
Page 168, Table 5.6-1, method 2, part c,
   add "Zero all independent sources, then" between the
   "(c)" and the phrase "Connect a 1-A current source. . ."
   The edited phrase will read:
      "Zero all independent sources, then connect 
      a 1-A source from terminal b to terminal a.  
      Determine Vab.  Then Rt = Vab/1."
                                             <A NAME=ERR_185></A>
Page 185, Problem P5.5-9 part (b), change the "greater than" 
   symbol to a "greater than or equal to" symbol so that the 
   statement reads "(b) Given that R >= 0, determine. . ."
                                             <A NAME=ERR_186></A>
Page 186, Problem P5.6-4, answer is i   = 1.13 A, ("A" not "V").
                                             <A NAME=ERR_230></A>
Page 230, Problem P6.5-6, answers shown are wrong.  Correct 
   answers are:  Va = -12/13 V, Vb = 0 V, Vc = 15/13 V.
                     <A NAME="ERR_DP6-5"></A><A NAME=ERR_236></A>
Page 236, Problem DP6-5, insert the word "magnitude" after 
   "output voltage."  The third sentence of the problem statement 
   then reads, "It is desired to provide an output voltage 
   magnitude of 4 V."  (In the context of this chapter and the 
   work done so far, students will interpret the 20 mV signal as 
   DC, thus the need for the word, "magnitude," in the problem 
   statement.) 
                                             <A NAME=ERR_282></A>
Page 282, Problem P7.3-6.  In the hint, delete "V" (the unit 
   on x(t)).
                                             <A NAME=ERR_284></A>
Page 284, Problem P7.6-3.  In the hint, delete "V" (the unit 
   on x(t)) in two instances.
                                             <A NAME=ERR_285></A>
Page 285, Problem P7.7-1  There are at least two ways to fix this 
   problem. 

   1.) In the problem statement, change "mA" to "A" and "ms" to 
   "s".  In particular, the line that starts with "where" should 
   read:  "where the units of time are seconds and the units of 
   current are amperes."  After, "The units of p(t) are W and the 
   units of w(t) are J." add "Time, t, is in seconds." 

   2.) Alternatively: change the answers to match the given 
   units. Then 

          /
          | 0         if t <= 0
          |
   p(t) = | 1.6t      if 0 < t < 0.001
          |
          | 0         if t >= 0.001
          \

          /         
          | 0         if t <= 0
          |     2
   w(t) = | 0.8t      if 0 < t < 0.001
          |       -5
          | 8 x 10    if t >= 0.001
          \
   
   Where in the answers, the units for p(t) are W, the units for 
   w(t) are J, and t is in seconds. 

                                             <A NAME=ERR_339></A>
Page 339, Problem P8.3-1, answer should be:

                              -t/750 us
                 v(t) = 6 - 2e          V, t >= 0
                                             <A NAME=ERR_341></A>
Page 341, Problem P8.4-1,  The correct answer is

           /        -5t
           |  5 + 5e    V,            if 0 <= t <= 1.5 s
           |
   v(t) =  |
           |        -2.5(t - 1.5)
           | 10 - 5e              V,  if t > 1.5 s
           \
                                             <A NAME=ERR_386></A>
Page 386, Table 9.14-2, In the overdamped natural response both 
   exponents should be positive, as shown here:

                     A exp(s t) + A exp(s t)
                      1     1      2     2
                                             <A NAME=ERR_387></A>
Page 387, Problem P9.3-1.  The problem statement should read:

   "Find the differential equation for v  in the circuit..."
                                        C
   Also, label v  to the left of the capacitor with the "+"  
                C
   label on top.  (There are many differential equations "for the 

   circuit." The v  equation is the one sought for the answer.)
                  C
                                            <A NAME=ERR_387B></A>
Page 387, Problem P9.3-2.  The problem statement should read:

   "Find the differential equation for i  in the circuit..."
                                        L
                                             <A NAME=ERR_455></A>
Page 455, Problem P10.6-2.  In the answer, the correct angle is  
   "84" degrees, not "85" degrees.
                                             <A NAME=ERR_456></A>
Page 456, Problem P10.7.3.  The unit on each current source
   should be "A" for amperes, not "V."  (Two instances.)
                                            <A NAME=ERR_456B></A>
Page 456, Problem P10.8.2.  The current arrow shown in the 
   schematic is backwards.  Change it so that it points to the 
   left.  (posted 12/06/06)
                                             <A NAME=ERR_514></A>
Page 514, Problem P11.4-4.  In the answer change 

   "I    = 5 mA" to "I    = 4.33 mA"
     rms              rms

   (One could do an alternative problem, call it "part c," which 
   is similar to part b except change the illustration to show 
   half cycles of 10sin(wt) instead of full cycles of 
   (5 - 5cos(2wt)) for the non-zero portions of the waveform.  
   Then the correct answer will be 5 mA.)
                                             <A NAME=ERR_556></A>
Page 556, Problem P12.7-1.  In the last sentence change "curents" 
   to "current magnitudes" so that the last sentence reads, "Find 
   the line current magnitudes and the power delievered to. . ." 
                                             <A NAME=ERR_687></A>
Page 687, Eq. 15.5-2.  The lower limit of summation
   should be n = -infinity.
