If you are considering purchasing this textbook but are worried that 
it is a poor choice due to this list of known errata, please
don't worry about that.  Competing textbooks have about as many errata, 
but perhaps no list like this.  "Better the devil you know than the 
devil you don't know." Professor De Boer likes this book enough 
to find it worthwhile to publish this list of errata.  
                                                    </small></p><br>
This list is in addition to the <a href=
"http://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780199339136/errata/"
>publisher's list of errata</a>.<br><br>               
              
This list was prepared from the first printing of the textbook.<br>
Some of these errata may be corrected in later printings. 
Some additional errata could accidentally be introduced into later 
printings!  Where I have information on errata unique to later 
printings, there are appropriate annotations.</p>

   The integral has an upper limit of <i>t</i>, but it also 
   uses the symbol <i>t</i> as the variable of integration.  
   The limit and the variable of integration cannot be 
   one-and-the-same.  Change the variable of integration to &lambda;.

Page 373,  Figure 7.4(b)--Incorrectly shaped slope between Q and B. </b><br>
   The artist's inclusion of an inflection in the slope of the 
   curve between Q and B is wrong. Point A is the vertex of a 
   downward-opening parabola. The curve between points A and B 
   is entirely parabolic, as described by Equation 7.5 on page 
   370.  The slope continues to become monotonically more negative 
   going along the arc from A, through Q, to B.  The curve from 
   point C to point B meets that arc tangentially at point B so 
   that there is no discontinuity in the slope of the curve.  
   Figure 7.3(b) shows these details correctly.  (This same

   The operator colloquially called "in parallel with" can be

   <i>a</i>||<i>b</i> = 1/[(1/<i>a</i>) + (1/<i>b</i>)]<br><br>
   
   In other words, || can mean, 
   &quot;take the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals.&quot;
   Given this interpretation, the expression 
   <i>R<sub>SS</sub></i>||<i>C<sub>SS</sub></i> has a mis-match 
   of units.  Expressing this concept in terms of impedances is 
   more correct.<br><br>
   
   The use of the || symbol as a mathematical 
   operator, rather than simply as a substitute for the phrase, 
   &quot;in parallel with&quot; is well entrenched in electrical 
   engineering literature but is not formally standardized as 
   far as Prof. <span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:120%"
   >d</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:80%"
   >DB</span> knows.  This can lead to real confusion.  For
   example, in the expression <br><i>C<sub>eq</sub></i> = 
   <i>C<sub>1</sub></i>||<i>C<sub>2</sub></i> does this mean that 
   the capacitors are, &quot;in parallel&quot; and thus the 
   equivalent capacity is a sum, or does it mean that the capacitors
   are in series and the equivalent capacity is, &quot;the reciprocal of
   the sum of the reciprocals?&quot;  This confusion can be avoided by
   using the parallel symbol, ||, only with impeadances, e.g.
   <i>Z<sub>eq</sub></i> = <i>Z<sub>C<sub>1</sub></sub></i>||<i>Z<sub>C<sub>2</sub></sub></i>. 
   Then the symbol means the same thing no matter which way 
   it is interpreted. <br><i>Reference</i>:

   A few other authors along with Sedra and Smith treat

   a voltage ratio (not a power ratio), nevertheless, it does 
   not agree with industry practice.  Some examples are:<br>

   The answers given do not meet the specifications of the problem 
   statement.  With a little calculation it is clear that the emitter
   current will be out-of-specification for the <i>&beta;</i> = 50 case.
   Correct answers are:<br><br>   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
   
       <i>R<sub>B</i> = 30 k&Omega;, &nbsp; <i>R<sub>C</i> = 4 k&Omega;, &nbsp; 
       <i>R<sub>E</i> = 4 k&Omega;, <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	   (0.919 mA) &le; <i>I<sub>C</sub></i> &le; (1.004 mA) &nbsp; and &nbsp; 
	   (&ndash;1.33 V) &le; <i>V<sub>C</sub></i> &le; (&ndash;0.903 V)<br><br>
	   
   <i>Hint: It is not sufficient to solve for the three resistor values
   and then round all three values.  The emitter current is particularly
   sensitive to the value of <i>R<sub>E</sub></i>.  After that is rounded
   it will be necessary to recalculate <i>R<sub>B</sub></i> to reset 
   the emitter current back to 1 mA for the case of <i>&beta;</i> = 100.</i><br><br>
   
   Note:  A case might be made for adjusting <i>R<sub>B</sub></i> as high 
   as 39 k&Omega;.  All specifications will then be met except that the
   emitter current for the case of </i>&beta;</i> = 100 will be a bit low.

An equivalent problem (Implying the same questions and giving the 
same answer) is as follows:<br><br>

Suppose a temperature sensor is at a temperature of <i>T</i>
degrees centigrade.  At this temperature and without the load 
resistance connected, an ideal voltmeter shows the output 
voltage to be <i>V</i> millivolts.  A 5&nbsp;k&Omega; load
resistance is now connected but the temperature is not changed.
The terminal voltage of the sensor is reduced to 
<i>V</i>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;10 millivolts.  Now the temperature 
is increased until the terminal voltage returns to <i>V</i> 
millivolts.  It is observed that the temperature was increased
10 degrees centigrade to accomplish this.  <!--Now the load is 
disconnected but the temperature is held constant at the 
elevated amount of <i>T</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;10 degrees centigrade.  
The output of the sensor is now <i>V</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;20 
millivolts. --> What is the source resistance of the sensor?<br>

Page 121 Problem D2.34 part (b)</b><br>
The output resistance of the "current amplifier" is requested.  
The variable <i>v<sub>o</sub></i> designates the output of the 
"operational amplifier" which is confusingly, not the output of 
the "current amplifier."  The output of the "current amplifier" 
is the current, <i>i<sub>L</sub></i> through the load resistor, 
<i>R<sub>L</sub></i>.  
                                                        <br><br>

Hint: Add label <i>V<sub>L</sub></i> under <i>R<sub>L</sub></i> 
and polarity marks "+" and "&ndash;" on either side with the "+"
on the left.  Then the output of the "current amplifier" is the 
load current, <i>i<sub>L</sub></i> = 
<i>V<sub>L</sub></i>/<i>R<sub>L</sub></i>.              <br><br>

To find the output resistance of the "current amplifier," replace 
<i>R<sub>L</sub></i> by a test source, <i>V<sub>x</sub></i> 
such that <i>V<sub>L</sub></i> = <i>V<sub>x</sub></i>.  Then, 
with the input of the "current amplifier" zeroed 
(<i>i<sub>I</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 or open) find 
<i>i<sub>L</sub></i> in terms of <i>V<sub>L</sub></i>.  Then the 
output resistance is 
<i>R<sub>o</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>V<sub>L</sub></i>/<i>i<sub>L</sub></i>.  
See text page 29 for the basic theory.  Note that for a current 
amplifier, a zero input is an open.  (Whereas, for a voltage 
amplifier a zero input is a connection to ground.)           <br>

<b>Clarification #2</b>                 <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The two resistors connected to the non-inverting ("+") inputs of
the op-amps are for the purpose of reducing the non-ideal effects
of input bias currents to the op-amps.  The assumption of an 
"ideal" op-amp makes these resistors unimportant to the operation 
of the circuit, no matter what their values are.  If the op-amps 
are ideal these resistors may be set to zero (replaced with wires) 
without any change to the operation of the circuit.  Additionally, 
although the two 10 k<img src=omega_uc.gif alt="ohm"> resistors as 
shown will reduce the harmful non-ideal effects of input bias 
currents, these resistors are not shown with their optimal values.  
For this circuit, the non-inverting input of the top op-amp should 
be connected to node A through a 
6.67&nbsp;k<img src=omega_uc.gif alt="ohm"> resistor.  The 
non-inverting input of the bottom op-amp should be connected to 
ground through a 7.5&nbsp;k<img src=omega_uc.gif alt="ohm"> 
resistor.  These are the Thevenin-equivalent resistances seen by
the inverting inputs of the op-amps.  If this makes no sense to 
you and you are further interested, ask professor De&nbsp;Boer 
about it. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <small><i>

   The "50-<img src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohm"> coaxial cable" is 
   just a wire with a shield around it.  Specifically, the 
   resistance from one end of the cable to the other is ZERO.  
   The resistance from the drain of <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> to 
   the source of <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> is 0 <img src="omega_uc.gif" 
   alt="ohms">. <br><br>
   
   However, the cable is long enough so that it takes a noticeable 
   amount of time for a signal to travel through the cable (or wire).  
   Because of this propagation time, the cable works better when 
   the load on the cable is of the specific value for which the 
   cable is designed.  This cable is designed for a 50 <img 
   src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohm"> load, thus it is <i>called</i> 
   a "50 <img src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohms"> cable," but just as
   for a wire, the resistance of the cable from end-to-end is 
   (practically) zero.  Thus the goal of the problem is to make 
   <i>R</i><sub>i2</sub>, the resistance looking into the source 
   of <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub>, be 50 <img src="omega_uc.gif" 
   alt="ohms"> so that the cable works as well as possible with 
   respect to transferring high-bandwidth (fast) signals.<br><br>
