If you are considering purchasing this textbook and worrying that 
it is a poor choice due to the length of this list of errata, please
reconsider.  Competing textbooks have about as many errata, but perhaps
no list like this.  "Better the devil you know than the devil you don't." 
Professor <br>De Boer likes this book enough to find it worthwhile
to publish this list of errata.

   In the first line of the problem statement delete the space 
   between the number 2.5 and the "<I>&#181;<sub>p</sub></I>". 
   Also, put the number in parenthesis.  The first line then ends 
   with this expression: 
   <p align="center"><I>&#181;<sub>n</sub>C<sub>ox</sub></I> = 
   (2.5)<I>&#181;<sub>p</sub>C<sub>ox</sub></I> =</p>

   Better: just specify directly what is intended: <br> 
   <I>&#181;<sub>n</sub>C<sub>ox</sub></I> =

   (As printed <I>&#181;<sub>n</sub>C<sub>ox</sub></I> = 2.5 
   &#181;A/V  is a correct reading but that was not the author's

   allow the distortion to be included in the calculation.  
   Second, "disregard" meaning assume a linear approximation as

The two resistors connected to the non-inverting ("+") inputs of
the op-amps are not the optimal values.  For this circuit, the 
non-inverting input of the top op-amp should be connected to node
A through a 6.67 k<img src=omega_uc.gif alt="ohm"> resistor.  The 
non-inverting input of the bottom op-amp should be connected to 
ground through a 7.5 k<img src=omega_uc.gif alt="ohm"> resistor.  
These assumption of an "ideal" op-amp makes these resistors 
unimportant to the operation of the circuit, no matter what their 
values are.  If the op-amps are not ideal, these two resistors 
reduce the effect of input bias currents.  If this makes no sense 
to you and you are further interested, ask professor De Boer about 
it.

   In the statement of the example problem 
   <I>V<sub>Z</sub></I> = 6.8 V at <I>I<sub>Z</sub></I> = 5 mA is 
   given.  This does not mean that the actual diode current, 
   labeled in blue as

   necessarily 5 mA.  It only means that if

   <I>V<sub>Z</sub></I> (and in the figure,

   Here is the question stated in one piece:<br><br>
   
   <font face="verdana" color="#0066CC" size="-1"><b>3.85</b></font>
   Augment the rectifier circuit shown in Figure 3.27 (page 176) 
   with a capacitor chosen to provide peak-to-peak ripple voltage 
   of (i) 10% of the peak output and (ii) 1% of the peak output.  
   In each case:<br><br>
   
   a.)  What average output voltage results?<br>
   b.)  What fraction of a cycle is there conduction through the bridge 
            of diodes?<br>
   c.)  What is the average current in each diode during conduction?<br>
   d.)  What is the peak diode current for each diode?<br><br>
   
   <small>(The original problem statement refers to problems 3.83 
   and 3.78.  Problem 3.83 refers to Problem 3.76.  Problem 3.78 
   refers by name (not by figure number) to Figure 3.27.  Students 
   have a hard time understanding the question.) Posted 10/21/2008.

   The main part of the problem is a proof ("Show that this 
   tangent. . .").   A sketch is requested to illustrate the proof.  
   An initial sketch might be easier if you assume numerical values 
   for the transistor's parameters, but keep the proof and the final 
   sketch generic (no specific numbers on the axes for example).  
   On the final sketch, label important features such as the 
   operating point and label the axes appropriately.
