                         TEXTBOOK ERRATA   (Last update  4/30/05) 
                         ---------------
  Sedra & Smith, Microelectronic Circuits, 5th Ed., Oxford, 2004. 

                                              <A NAME="P127"></A>
p127 Problem D2.33 part (c) add the word "Norton" between "a" and 
       "current".  Also add, "Assume ideal operation without 
       saturation" to the end of the problem statement.
                                              <A NAME="P361"></A>
p361 Problem 4.18, part (a) insert "(1/2)" between the equals 
       sign and the k'.  The equation should be:

                          1  W          2
                      i = -k'-(v - |V |)
                          2  L       t
                                              <A NAME="P365"></A>
p365 Problem 4.46.  In the first line of the problem statement
       delete the space between the number 2.5 and the "mu".
       Also, put the number in parenthesis.  The first line then
       ends with this equation:

                      u C   = (2.5)u C   = 
                       n ox         p ox

       Better: just specify what is intended directly:

                      2                 2
       u C   = 20 uA/V ,  u C   8 8 uA/V  
        n ox               p ox

                                    2
       (As printed u C   = 2.5 uA/V  is a correct reading
                    n ox

       but that was not the author's intention.)
                                              <A NAME="P366"></A>
p366 Problem 4.49 part (c) replace the phrase, "and disregarding 
       "the distortion caused by the MOSFET's square-law 
       characteristic," with the phrase, "and by using equations 
       valid for large signals," . . . 
       
       (The printed phrase is ambiguous.  It has at least two 
       equally valid interpretations.  First, as the author 
       intended, "disregard," meaning "do not use a small-signal 
       approximation to eliminate the distortion from the 
       calculation, instead allow the distortion to be included 
       in the calculation.  Second, "disregard," meaning assume a 
       linear approximation as if no distortion existed.) 
                                              <A NAME="P369"></A>
p369 Problem 4.74.  Replace the first sentence with:  "Model the 
       NMOS amplifier shown in Fig. P4.74 using the T equivalent 
       model shown in Fig. 4.39(d)."  

       ("Replace the transistor. . ." misleads students into 
       thinking that the DC sources, VDD and VSS play a part in 
       the solution.  In the needed small-signal analysis those 
       DC sources get set to zero (or ground).)
                                              <A NAME="P593"></A>
p593 Equation 6.67.  In the numerator, replace the last instance 
       of Cgs with Cgd.

                                              <A NAME="P672"></A>
p672 Problem 6.57.  Change part (a) so that it reads as follows:

       (a) Neglecting the DC current in the feedback network and 

       the effect of r , find V  .  Then find the DC current in  
                      o        GS
       the feedback network and V  .  Verify that you were 
                                 DS
       justified in neglecting the current in the feedback 

       network when you found V  .
                               GS 

       (Note:  Given the original wording, many students assume

       V   = V   since there is "no current in the feedback 
        DS    GS
       network," but this gives incorrect results.)
                                              <A NAME="P777"></A>
p777 Problem D7.24.  Change "let the BJT B [beta] be very large:" 
       to "let the BJT B [beta] = 100:"  (Part d requires that 
       beta = 100, so the formulae developed in parts a-c should 
       include finite beta.  (Also note that the answer in the 
       back of the book is wrong.  See <A HREF="#A7_24"
       >pH-4</A> below.)

                                              <A NAME="A9_1"></A>
p H-1, Answer to problem 1.9.  Change the second instance of 
       "157" to "106".  Also fix the grammar:  Just before the 
       first instance of "a 157" add the word "with".  
                                              <A NAME="A3_9"></A>
p H-2, Answer to problem 3.9 part b should be "-1.67 V; 0 A."
       (A minus sign is missing in the text.)
                                             <A NAME="A3_78"></A>
p H-2, Answer to problem 3.78.  Change "94.7%" to "47.4%."
       (Alternatively, change the question.  Specifically 
       change, "For what fraction of a cycle does the diode 
       conduct?" to, "For what fraction of a cycle is there 
       conduction through the load?"  Answer: 94.7%)
                                             <A NAME="A4_34"></A>
p H-2, Answers given to problem 4.34 are wrong.

       The correct answers are R  = 2.5 Kohms, R  = 500 ohms.
                                D               S

       (Alternatively, to find the answers given in the text, 
       change "2.5 V" to "5 V" in two places on Fig. 4.20.)
                                             <A NAME="A4_46"></A>
p H-2, Answer to problem 4.46 (b) is inaccurate.  Change "4.8 uA" 
       "to 4.5 uA"  Students should express answers to part (b) 
       that are accurate to at least 3 significant figures. 
                                             <A NAME="A4_65"></A>
p H-2, Answers to problem 4.65 are inaccurate.  Correct answers 
       are: 36 kohms, 195 uA, 1.99 V.  (Increasing RD cannot 
       increase the current!) 
                                              <A NAME="A5_1"></A>
p H-3, In the answer to problem 5.1 change the last instance of 
       the word "cutoff" to "active."  (Alternatively, in the 
       problem statement for line 8, change the instance of "5.0" 
       in the "B" column to "-0.5."  Then the answer is 
       "cutoff.") (Posted 1/13/05)
                                             <A NAME="A5_20"></A>
p H-3, In the answer to problem 5.20 part (d), 
       change "0.35 V" to "-4.475 V" (Posted 1/25/05)
                                             <A NAME="A5_67"></A>
p H-3, In the answer to problem 5.67 part (b) 
       change "1.8 mA, 0.3 mA" to "0.2 mA; 2.3 mA" (1/25/05)
                                             <A NAME="A7_24"></A>
p H-4, In the answer to problem D7-24 change "I" to "[alpha]I" 
       in each instance of parts a and b.  In part d change 
       "0.4 mA, 10 kohms" to 0.404 mA, "9.90 kohms."

                                             <A NAME="A7_37"></A>
p H-4, In the answer to problem 7-37 change "40 V/V; 50 kohms" to
       "33.0 V/V; 60.6 kohms." (Posted 4/25/05, edited 4/30/05)


Additional notes:
(Clarifications--not errata)
----------------------------                  <A NAME="P169"></A>
p169 In the statement of the example problem Vz = 6.8 V at Iz = 5 
   mA is given.  This does not mean that the actual diode 
   current, labeled in blue as "Iz" on the figure, is necessarily 
   5 mA.  It only means that if Iz is 5 mA then Vz (and in the 
   figure, Vo) will be 6.8 V. 
                                              <A NAME="P805"></A>
p805, Figure 8.10.  The circuit element h   has units of 
                                         22
   conductance (siemens).  The actual resistance is 1/h   ohms.
                                                       22
   This is not a miss-print since conductors and resistors share 

   the same symbol.  (Applies to parts b and c of the figure.)
