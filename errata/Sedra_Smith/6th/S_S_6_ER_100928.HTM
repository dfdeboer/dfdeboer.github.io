   The discussion of signal-to-interference ratio presented (as 
   printed) is in terms of a voltage ratio.  This is not a common 
   practice in the industry.  Usually the signal-to-interference 
   ratio is defined as a power ratio.  More generally, the 
   signal-to-interference ratio is a special type of 
   signal-to-noise ratio, which is also a power ratio.  The 
   following changes make the text conform to industry standard 
   practice.<br><br>
   
   Change the second line under heading 10.2.3 by <br>
   adding the word "power" in two places so that the line 
   reads:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;

   power.  However. . ."<br><br>

   adding the word "power" so that the line reads:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   "amplifier.  The <b>signal-to-noise power ratio</b> for this 
   amplifier is"<br><br>

 
   Change Equation 10.14 to &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>S</i>/<i>I</i> =

   Change the line above Equation 10.16 by <br>
   adding the word "power" so that the line reads:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "Thus the signal-to-noise power ratio at the output
   becomes"<br><br>

Page 112 Problem D2.34 part (b)</b><br>
The output resistance of the "current amplifier" is requested.  
The variable <i>v<sub>o</sub></i> designates the output of the 
"operational amplifier" which is confusingly, not the output of 
the "current amplifier."  The output of the "current amplifier" 
is found at the two terminals of <i>R<sub>L</sub></i>.  <br><br>

Add label <i>V<sub>L</sub></i> under <i>R<sub>L</sub></i> and 
polarity marks "+" and "&ndash;" on either side with the "+"
on the left.  Then the output of the "current amplifier" is at
the two terminals marked by these new polarity marks.  
Resistor <i>R<sub>L</sub></i> is the load on the "current 
amplifier."                                              <br><br>

To find
the output resistance of the "current amplifier," replace 
<i>R<sub>L</sub></i> by a test source, <i>V<sub>x</sub></i> 
such that <i>V<sub>L</sub></i> = <i>V<sub>x</sub></i>.  Then, 
with the input of the "current amplifier" zeroed 
(<i>i<sub>I</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 or open) find 
<i>i<sub>L</sub></i> in terms of <i>V<sub>L</sub></i>.  Then the 
output resistance is 
<i>R<sub>o</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>V<sub>L</sub></i>/<i>i<sub>L</sub></i>.  
See text page 27 for the basic theory.  Note that for a current 
amplifier, a zero input is an open.  (Whereas, for a voltage 
amplifier a zero input is a connection to ground.)

Page 118.  Problem *2.77 and Figure P2.77</b><br>
The two resistors connected to the non-inverting ("+") inputs of
the op-amps are not the optimal values.  For this circuit, the 
non-inverting input of the top op-amp should be connected to node
A through a 6.67 k<img src=omega_uc.gif alt="ohm"> resistor.  The 
non-inverting input of the bottom op-amp should be connected to 
ground through a 7.5 k<img src=omega_uc.gif alt="ohm"> resistor.  
The assumption of an "ideal" op-amp makes these resistors 
unimportant to the operation of the circuit, no matter what their 
values are.  If the op-amps are not ideal, these two resistors 
reduce the effect of input bias currents.  If this makes no sense 
to you and you are further interested, ask professor De Boer about 
it.

Page 346, Problem 5.114.</b><br>
   The "50-<img src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohm"> coaxial cable" is 
   just a wire with a shield around it.  Specifically, the 
   resistance from one end of the cable to the other is ZERO.  
   The reisistance from the drain of <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> to 
   the source of <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> is 0 <img src="omega_uc.gif" 
   alt="ohms">. <br><br>
   
   However, the cable is long enough so that it takes a noticable 
   amount of time for a signal to travel through the cable (or wire).  
   Because of this propagation time, the cable works better when 
   the load on the cable is of the specific value for which the 
   cable is designed.  This cable is designed for a 50 <img 
   src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohm"> load, thus it is <i>called</i> 
   a "50 <img src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohms"> cable," but just as
   for a wire, the resistance of the cable from end-to-end is 
   (practically) zero.  Thus the goal of the problem is to make 
   <i>R</i><sub>i2</sub>, the resistance looking into the source 
   of <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub>, be 50 <img src="omega_uc.gif" 
   alt="ohms"> so that the cable works as well as possible with 
   respect to transferring high-bandwidth (fast) signals.<br><br>

   An initial sketch might be easier if you assume numerical values
