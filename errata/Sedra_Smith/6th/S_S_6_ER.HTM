If you are considering purchasing this textbook but are worried that 
it is a poor choice due to the length of this list of errata, please
don't worry about that.  Competing textbooks have about as many errata, 
but perhaps no list like this.  "Better the devil you know than the 
devil you don't know." Professor De Boer likes this book enough 
to find it worthwhile to publish this list of errata.  
                                                    </small></p><br>
             
              
              
This list was prepared from the first printing
of the textbook.<br>
Some of these errata have been corrected in later printings, 
which is easy to understand.  Some additional errata have been
accidentally introduced into later printings!  Where I have
information on errata unique to later printings, I have 
included appropriate corrections.</p>

   The discussion of signal-to-interference ratio presented (as 
   printed) is in terms of a voltage ratio.  This is not a common 
   practice in the industry.  Usually the signal-to-interference 
   ratio is defined as a power ratio.  More generally, the 
   signal-to-interference ratio is a special type of 
   signal-to-noise ratio, which is also a power ratio.  The 
   following changes make the text conform to industry standard 
   practice.<br><br>
   
   Change the second line under heading 10.2.3 by <br>
   adding the word "power" in two places so that the line 
   reads:<br>
   ". . .to increase the ratio of signal power to interferance
   power.  However. . ."<br><br>
   
   Change the line just above Equation 10.14 by <br>
   adding the word "power" so that the line reads:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   "amplifier.  The <b>signal-to-noise power ratio</b> for this 
   amplifier is"<br><br>

 
   Change Equation 10.14 to &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>S</i>/<i>I</i> = 
   <i>V<sub>s</sub></i><sup>2</sup>/<i>V<sub>n</sub></i><sup>2</sup>
   <br><br>
   
   Change the line above Equation 10.16 by <br>
   adding the word "power" so that the line reads:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "Thus the signal-to-noise power ratio at the output
   becomes"<br><br>
   
   Change Equation 10.16 to &nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <img src="EQ10_16.GIF" align="middle"><br><br>
   
   In the line below Equation 10.16 change, "which is

An equivalent problem (Implying the same questions and giving the 
same answer) is as follows:<br><br>

Suppose a temperature sensor is at a temperature of <i>T</i>
degrees centigrade.  At this temperature and without the load 
resistance connected, an ideal voltmeter shows the output 
voltage to be <i>V</i> millivolts.  A 10&nbsp;k&Omega; load
resistance is now connected but the temperature is not changed.
The terminal voltage of the sensor is reduced to 
<i>V</i>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;10 millivolts.  Now the temperature 
is increased until the terminal voltage returns to <i>V</i> 
millivolts.  It is observed that the temperature was increased
10 degrees centigrade to accomplish this.  Now the load is 
disconnected but the temperature is held constant at the 
elevated amount of <i>T</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;10 degrees centigrade.  
The output of the sensor is now <i>V</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;20 
millivolts.  What is the source resistance of the sensor?<br><br>

Page 112 Problem D2.34 part (b)</b><br>
The output resistance of the "current amplifier" is requested.  
The variable <i>v<sub>o</sub></i> designates the output of the 
"operational amplifier" which is confusingly, not the output of 
the "current amplifier."  The output of the "current amplifier" 
is found at the two terminals of <i>R<sub>L</sub></i>.  <br><br>

Add label <i>V<sub>L</sub></i> under <i>R<sub>L</sub></i> and 
polarity marks "+" and "&ndash;" on either side with the "+"
on the left.  Then the output of the "current amplifier" is at
the two terminals marked by these new polarity marks.  
Resistor <i>R<sub>L</sub></i> is the load on the "current 
amplifier."                                              <br><br>

To find
the output resistance of the "current amplifier," replace 
<i>R<sub>L</sub></i> by a test source, <i>V<sub>x</sub></i> 
such that <i>V<sub>L</sub></i> = <i>V<sub>x</sub></i>.  Then, 
with the input of the "current amplifier" zeroed 
(<i>i<sub>I</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 or open) find 
<i>i<sub>L</sub></i> in terms of <i>V<sub>L</sub></i>.  Then the 
output resistance is 
<i>R<sub>o</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>V<sub>L</sub></i>/<i>i<sub>L</sub></i>.  
See text page 27 for the basic theory.  Note that for a current 
amplifier, a zero input is an open.  (Whereas, for a voltage 
amplifier a zero input is a connection to ground.)

Page 118.  Problem *2.77 and Figure P2.77</b><br>
The two resistors connected to the non-inverting ("+") inputs of
the op-amps are not the optimal values.  For this circuit, the 
non-inverting input of the top op-amp should be connected to node
A through a 6.67 k<img src=omega_uc.gif alt="ohm"> resistor.  The 
non-inverting input of the bottom op-amp should be connected to 
ground through a 7.5 k<img src=omega_uc.gif alt="ohm"> resistor.  
The assumption of an "ideal" op-amp makes these resistors 
unimportant to the operation of the circuit, no matter what their 
values are.  If the op-amps are not ideal, these two resistors 
reduce the effect of input bias currents.  If this makes no sense 
to you and you are further interested, ask professor De Boer about 
it.

Page 346, Problem 5.114.</b><br>
   The "50-<img src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohm"> coaxial cable" is 
   just a wire with a shield around it.  Specifically, the 
   resistance from one end of the cable to the other is ZERO.  
   The reisistance from the drain of <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> to 
   the source of <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> is 0 <img src="omega_uc.gif" 
   alt="ohms">. <br><br>
   
   However, the cable is long enough so that it takes a noticable 
   amount of time for a signal to travel through the cable (or wire).  
   Because of this propagation time, the cable works better when 
   the load on the cable is of the specific value for which the 
   cable is designed.  This cable is designed for a 50 <img 
   src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohm"> load, thus it is <i>called</i> 
   a "50 <img src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohms"> cable," but just as
   for a wire, the resistance of the cable from end-to-end is 
   (practically) zero.  Thus the goal of the problem is to make 
   <i>R</i><sub>i2</sub>, the resistance looking into the source

   In this problem we investigate the large-signal operation of the source<br>
   follower of Fig. 5.60(a).  Specifically, consider the situation when negative<br> 
   input signals are applied. Let the negative signal voltage at the output be 
      &ndash;<i>V</i>.<br>
   The current in <i>R<sub>L</sub></i> will flow away from ground and will have 
      a value of <i>V</i>/<i>R<sub>L</sub></i>.<br>
   This current will subtract from the bias current <i>I</i>, resulting in a 
      transistor<br>
   source (and drain) current of (<i>I</i> &ndash; <i>V</i>/<i>R<sub>L</sub></i>).  
      One can use this current value to<br>
   determine <i>v<sub>GS</sub></i>.  Now, the signal at the transistor source 
      terminal will be <br>
   <i>v<sub>o</sub></i> = &ndash;V superimposed on the dc bias voltage, which 
      is &ndash;<i>V<sub>GS</sub></i> (corresponding<br>
   to a drain current of <i>I</i>). We can thus find the signal voltage at the 
      gate, <i>v<sub>i</sub></i>.  In<br>
   Figure 5.60(a),&nbsp; let <i>I</i> = 0.5 mA, <i>V<sub>t</sub></i> = 1.5 V, 
      <i>k'<sub>n</sub></i>(<i>W</i>/<i>L</i>) = 1 mA/V<sup>2</sup>, 
       <i>R<sub>L</sub></i> = 15 k&Omega; <br>
   and ignore the Early effect.  Note that this bias situation is similar 
      to that used<br>
   in Exercises 5.37 on page 315 and Excercise 5.41 on apge 321. For this <br>
   circuit, find <i>v<sub>i</sub></i> if <i>v<sub>o</sub></i> = &ndash;1.  
      Repeat for <i>v<sub>o</sub></i> = &ndash;5, &nbsp; <i>v<sub>o</sub></i> 
      = &ndash;6, and <i>v<sub>o</sub></i> = &ndash;7.  At each <br>
   output voltage, find the large signal gain, 
      <i>v<sub>o</sub></i>/<i>v<sub>i</sub></i> and compare to the small<br>
   signal value, <i>A<sub>v</sub></i> found in Excercise 5.41 (page 322).

   For the BJT transistor assume <img src="beta_ital.gif" 
   alt="beta"> is infinite.  For both the MOSFET and the BJT 
   ignore the Early effect.

   In parts b and c of Figure 10.14, the circuit element 
   <I>h<sub>22</sub></I> has units of conductance (siemens).  The 
   actual resistance is (1/<I>h<sub>22</sub></I>) <img 
   src=omega_uc.gif alt="ohms">.  In part (c) of Figure 1.14 
   <I>h<sub>22</sub></I> is shown in parallel with 
   <i>R<sub>L</sub></i>.  Then in Figure 10.15 this same 
   conductance is shown instead as a resistance, 
   <i>R</i><sub>22</sub>.  This is not a miss-print since 
   conductors and resistors share the same symbol.  It is 
   just a matter of notation. Remember that 
   <i>R</i><sub>22</sub> = 1/<I>h<sub>22</sub></I>.
