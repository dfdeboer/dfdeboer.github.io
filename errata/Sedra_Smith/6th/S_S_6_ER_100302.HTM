   The discussion of signal-to-interference ratio presented (as 
   printed) is in terms of a voltage ratio.  This is not a common 
   practice in the industry.  Usually the signal-to-interference 
   ratio is defined as a power ratio.  More generally, the 
   signal-to-interference ratio is a special type of 
   signal-to-noise ratio, which is also a power ratio.  The 
   following changes make the text conform to industry standard 
   practice.<br><br>
   
   Change the second line under heading 10.2.3 by <br>
   adding the word "power" in two places so that the line 
   reads:<br>
   ". . .to increase the ratio of signal power to interferance
   power.  However. . ."<br><br>
   
   Change the line just above Equation 10.14 by <br>
   adding the word "power" so that the line reads:<br>
   "amplifier.  The <b>signal-to-noise power ratio</b> for this 
   amplifier is"<br><br>

 
   Change Equation 10.14 to &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>S</i>/<i>I</i> = 
   <i>V<sub>s</sub></i><sup>2</sup>/<i>V<sub>n</sub></i><sup>2</sup>
   <br><br>
   
   Change the line above Equation 10.16 by <br>
   adding the word "power" so that the line reads:<br> 
   "Thus the signal-to-noise power ratio at the output
   becomes"<br><br>
   
   Change Equation 10.16 to &nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <img src="EQ10_16.GIF" align="middle"><br><br>
   
   In the line below Equation 10.16 change, "which is

   "which is <i>A</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> times higher".<br>

Page 118.  Problem *2.77 and Figure P2.77</b><br>
The two resistors connected to the non-inverting ("+") inputs of
the op-amps are not the optimal values.  For this circuit, the 
non-inverting input of the top op-amp should be connected to node
A through a 6.67 k<img src=omega_uc.gif alt="ohm"> resistor.  The 
non-inverting input of the bottom op-amp should be connected to 
ground through a 7.5 k<img src=omega_uc.gif alt="ohm"> resistor.  
These assumption of an "ideal" op-amp makes these resistors 
unimportant to the operation of the circuit, no matter what their 
values are.  If the op-amps are not ideal, these two resistors 
reduce the effect of input bias currents.  If this makes no sense 
to you and you are further interested, ask professor De Boer about 
it.

For stylistic consistency, in the denominator 
of the equation the second instance of <I>j</I> could be inside 
the parenthesis.  The complete denominator is then</P><P align="center"> 
 
[1 + (<i>w<sub>1</sub></i>/<i>jw</i>)][1 + 
(<i>jw</i>/<i>w<sub>2</sub></i>)]</P>

Either way, the equation means the same thing.

   In the statement of the example problem 
   <I>V<sub>Z</sub></I> = 6.8 V at <I>I<sub>Z</sub></I> = 5 mA is 
   given.  This does not mean that the actual diode current, 
   labeled in blue as 
   "<font color="#006699"><I>I<sub>Z</sub></I></font>" on the figure, is 
   necessarily 5 mA.  It only means that if

   Here is the question stated in one piece:<br><br>
   
   <font face="verdana" color="#0066CC" size="-1"><b>3.85</b></font>
   Augment the rectifier circuit shown in Figure 3.27 (page 176) 
   with a capacitor chosen to provide peak-to-peak ripple voltage 
   of (i) 10% of the peak output and (ii) 1% of the peak output.  
   In each case:<br><br>
   
   a.)  What average output voltage results?<br>
   b.)  What fraction of a cycle is there conduction through the bridge 
            of diodes?<br>
   c.)  What is the average current in each diode during conduction?<br>
   d.)  What is the peak diode current for each diode?<br><br>

   and 3.78.  Problem 3.83 refers to Problem 3.76.  Problem 3.78 
   refers by name (not by figure number) to Figure 3.27.  Students 
   have a hard time understanding the question.) Posted 10/21/2008.

Page 346, Problem 5.114.</b><br>
   The "50-<img src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohm"> coaxial cable" is 
   just a wire with a shield around it.  Specifically, the 
   resistance from one end of the cable to the other is ZERO.  
   The reisistance from the drain of <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> to 
   the source of <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> is 0 <img src="omega_uc.gif" 
   alt="ohms">. <br><br>
   
   However, the cable is long enough so that it takes a noticable 
   amount of time for a signal to travel through the cable (or wire).  
   Because of this propagation time, the cable works better when 
   the load on the cable is of the specific value for which the 
   cable is designed.  This cable is designed for a 50 <img 
   src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohm"> load, thus it is <i>called</i> 
   a "50 <img src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohms"> cable, but just as
   for a wire, the resistance of the cable from end-to-end is 
   (practically) zero.  Thus the goal of the problem is to make 
   <i>R</i><sub>i2</sub>, the resistance looking into the source 
   of <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub>, be 50 <img src="omega_uc.gif" 
   alt="ohms"> so that the cable works as well as possible with 
   respect to transferring high-bandwidth (fast) signals.<br><br>

   The main part of the problem is a proof ("Show that this 
   tangent. . .").   A sketch is requested to illustrate the proof.  
   An initial sketch might be easier if you assume numerical values 
   for the transistor's parameters, but keep the proof and the final 
   sketch generic (no specific numbers on the axes for example).  
   On the final sketch, label important features such as the 
   operating point and label the axes appropriately.

   In parts b and c of the figure, the circuit element

   actual resistance is (1/<I>h<sub>22</sub></I>) <img
