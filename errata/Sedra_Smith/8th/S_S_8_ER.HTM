If you are considering purchasing this textbook but are worried that 
it is a poor choice due to this list of known errata, please
don't worry about that.  Competing textbooks have about as many errata, 
but perhaps no list like this.  "Better the devil you know than the 
devil you don't know." Professor De Boer likes this book enough 
to find it worthwhile to publish this list of errata.  
                                                    </small></p>

This list was prepared from the first printing of the hardcover version 
identified above.<br>
This list is expected to also be useful with the e-Book version 
(ISBN-0-19-085353-2) and the loose-leaf version (ISBN 978-0-19-085354-9).
Some of these errata may be corrected in later printings or other 
versions. Some additional errata could accidentally be introduced 
into later printings or other versions!  Where I have information 
on errata unique to various version and printings there are 
appropriate annotations.</p></small>

   370.  The slope continues to become monotonically more negative

   point C to point B meets that arc tangentially at point B so

   The wording of the problem statement in the textbook is ambiguous.  
   The maximum &Delta;<i>V<sub>t</sub></i> is the maximum difference one could 
   find between the two transistor's threshold voltages when one transistor 
   is compared to the other.  Thus, the total maximum mismatch of threshold 
   voltages is just 4 mV, say by making one 2 mV high and the other 2 mV low. 
   However, the variabilities specified for the <i>W</i>/<i>L</i> ratios and 
   for the <i>R<sub>D</sub></i> resistors are specified "independently," meaning 
   relative to their nominal values.  Thus <i>W</i><sub>1</sub>/<i>L</i><sub>1</sub> 
   could be 1% high while at the same time <i>W</i><sub>2</sub>/<i>L</i><sub>2</sub> 
   could be 1% low, for a total mismatch of 2%  The same applies to the drain

   In other words, || can mean,

   Given this interpretation, the expression 
   <i>R<sub>SS</sub></i>||<i>C<sub>SS</sub></i> has a mis-match 
   of units.  Expressing this concept in terms of impedances is 
   more correct.<br><br>
   
   The use of the || symbol as a mathematical

   &quot;in parallel with&quot; is well entrenched in electrical 
   engineering literature but is not formally standardized as 
   far as Prof. <span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:120%"
   >d</span><span style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:80%"
   >DB</span> knows.  This can lead to real confusion.  For
   example, in the expression <br><i>C<sub>eq</sub></i> = 
   <i>C<sub>1</sub></i>||<i>C<sub>2</sub></i> does this mean that 
   the capacitors are, &quot;in parallel&quot; and thus the 
   equivalent capacity is their sum, or does it mean that the capacitors
   are in series and the equivalent capacity is, &quot;the reciprocal of
   the sum of the reciprocals?&quot;  This confusion can be avoided by
   using the parallel symbol, ||, only with impedances, e.g.
   <i>Z<sub>eq</sub></i> = <i>Z<sub>C<sub>1</sub></sub></i>||<i>Z<sub>C<sub>2</sub></sub></i>. 
   Then the symbol is helpfully meaningful no matter if it is interpreted
   as the phrase, "in parallel with" or as the mathematical operator 
   meaning "reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals."<br><i>Reference</i>:

The output resistance of the "current amplifier" is requested.  
The variable <i>v<sub>o</sub></i> designates the output of the 
"operational amplifier" which is not the output of 
the "current amplifier."  The "current amplifier is the whole
circuit except for the load resistance <i>R</i><sub>L</sub>. 
The output of the "current amplifier" is the current, 
<i>i<sub>L</sub></i> through the load resistor, 
<i>R<sub>L</sub></i>.                                 <br><br>

Hint: In figure VE2.2 (page 71) add label <i>V<sub>L</sub></i> 
under <i>R<sub>L</sub></i> and polarity marks "+"&nbsp;and&nbsp;"&ndash;" 
on either side with the "+" on the left.  Then the output of 
the "current amplifier" is the load current, <i>i<sub>L</sub></i> 
= <i>V<sub>L</sub></i>/<i>R<sub>L</sub></i>.            <br><br>

To find the output resistance of the "current amplifier," replace 
<i>R<sub>L</sub></i> by a test source, <i>V<sub>x</sub></i> 
such that <i>V<sub>L</sub></i> = <i>V<sub>x</sub></i>.  Then, 
with the input of the "current amplifier" zeroed 
(<i>i<sub>I</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 or open) find 
<i>i<sub>L</sub></i> in terms of <i>V<sub>L</sub></i>.  Then the 
output resistance is 
<i>R<sub>o</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>V<sub>L</sub></i>/<i>i<sub>L</sub></i>.  
See text page 30 for the basic theory.  Note that for a current 
amplifier, a zero input is an open input.  (Whereas, for a voltage 
amplifier a zero input is an input shorted to ground.)           <br>

The two resistors connected to the non-inverting ("+") inputs of
the op-amps are for the purpose of reducing the non-ideal effects
of input bias currents to the op-amps.  The assumption of an 
"ideal" op-amp makes these resistors unimportant to the operation 
of the circuit, no matter what their values are (as long as the 
values are finite).  If the op-amps are ideal these resistors may 
be set to zero (replaced with wires) without any change to the 
operation of the circuit.  Additionally, although the two 
10 k&Omega; resistors as shown will reduce the harmful non-ideal 
effects of input bias currents, these resistors are not shown with 
their optimal values.  For this circuit, the non-inverting input 
of the top op-amp should be connected to node A through a 
10&nbsp;k&Omega;||10&nbsp;k&Omega;&nbsp;=&nbsp;5&nbsp;k&Omega; 
resistor.  The non-inverting input of the bottom op-amp should 
be connected to ground through a 
10&nbsp;k&Omega;||20&nbsp;k&Omega;&nbsp;=&nbsp;6.67&nbsp;k&Omega; 
resistor.  These are the Thevenin-equivalent resistances seen by

   Here is the question stated in one piece, with errata 
   corrected:</font><br><br>
   
   <font face="verdana" color="#0066CC" size="-1"><b>4.77</b></font>
   Let the full-wave bridge rectifier circuit shown in Figure 4.23 
   (page 213) operate from a 120&nbsp;V (rms) 60 Hz residential 
   supply line. Let the transformer have a 12:1 (step down) 
   turns ratio. Let the diodes be silicon diodes that can be 
   modeled to have a 0.7&nbsp;V drop for any forward current.  Let 
   the load resistor be 500 &Omega;.  Augment this rectifier circuit 
   with a capacitor chosen to provide peak-to-peak ripple voltage 
   of<br>
   (i) 10% of the peak output and <br> 
   (ii) 1% of the peak output.  <small><small><br>&nbsp;<br></small></small>

   In each of the above cases:<br>
   
   a.)  What average output voltage results?<br>
   b.)  For what fraction of a cycle is there conduction through 
        the secondary                       <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
        winding of the transformer?<br>
   c.)  What is the average current through each diode?<br>
   d.)  What is the peak current through each diode?<br><br><font color="green">

   refers by name&mdash;not by figure number&mdash;to Figure 4.21, 
   but students are supposed to substitute Figure 4.23 because 
   problem 4.69 refers to that by name and by way of superseding
   problem 4.68 because problem 4.77 mentions problem 4.70 instead
   of Problem 4.68.  Even some professors have a hard time

   1.)  When the problem refers to an "amplitude" it is referring 
   to the absolute value of the quantity.<br><br>
   2.)  The "50-<img src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohm"> coaxial cable" is 
   just a wire with a shield around it.  Specifically, the 
   resistance from one end of the cable to the other is ZERO.  
   The resistance from the drain of <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> to 
   the source of <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> is 0 <img src="omega_uc.gif" 
   alt="ohms">. <br><br>
   
   <i>Further explanation</i><br>
   However, the cable is long enough so that it takes a noticeable 
   amount of time for a signal to travel through the cable (or wire).  
   Because of this propagation time, the cable works better when 
   the load on the cable is of the specific value for which the 
   cable is designed.  This cable is designed for a 50&nbsp;&Omega; 
   load, thus it is <i>called</i> a "50-&Omega; coaxial cable," but just as
   for a wire, the resistance of the cable from end-to-end is 
   (practically) zero.  Thus the goal of the problem is to make 
   <i>R</i><sub>i2</sub>, the resistance looking into the source 
   of <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub>, be 50 &Omega; so that the cable works as well as possible with 
   respect to transferring high-bandwidth (fast) signals.<br><br>

   The wording of Part (b) of the problem statement in the textbook is a little confusing.  
   This problem is asking for the transconductance, <i>g<sub>m</sub></i><sub>1</sub>
   of transistor <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> only, plus the output resistance of 
   each of the transistors, <i>r<sub>o1</sub></i>, <i>r<sub>o2</sub></i>, and 
   <i>r<sub>o3</sub></i>.
   
   Equivalent and less ambiguous language is as follows:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
      b.) For transistor <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> find the transconductance, 
	  <i>g<sub>m</sub></i><sub>1</sub>.  &nbsp;For all three of <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
	  the transistors,	  find the associated output resistance due to Early <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
