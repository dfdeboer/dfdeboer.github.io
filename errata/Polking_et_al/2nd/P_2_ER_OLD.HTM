                         ---------------                12/02/05)
                   Polking, Boggess, and Arnold
        Differential Equations, 2nd Ed. ISBN 0-13-143738-0 
                   Pearson Prentice Hall, 2006.

Page 6, Problem 10
   Unclear: "...the force is inversely proportional to but 
            opposite the square of the particle's displacement 
            from the origin." 
   Clear:   "...the magnitude of the force is inversely 
            proportional to the square of the particle's 
            displacement from the origin but the direction of the 
            force is opposite to the direction of the particle's 
            displacement from the origin."

Page 13, Third line from the bottom.  The word "that" is 
   obscured or jumbled.

Page 35, Exercise 23
   Incorrect: ". . . the model N' = No*exp(-(lambda)t). . ."
   Correct:   ". . . the model N' = -(lambda)*N. . ."

Page 181, about 1/3 down the page, 
   "When s < a, the exponent is. . ." is incorrect.  The variables 
   "s" and "a" are in general elements of the complex numbers 
   and thus cannot be simply related as less than or greater 
   than.  The sentence should read, "When |s| < |a|, the exponent 
   could be. . ."  This problem persists throughout the chapter 
   and in the solutions given in the appendix.  In every case 
   where something like "provided s > a" is stated, it should be
   "provided |s| > |a|.

Page A-4, Section 2.5, Answer to Exercise 1 (from page 61)
   Incorrect: "9.038"
   Correct:   "9.0238" or just "9.024"

                                            <A NAME=ERR_A-10></A>
Page A-10, Section 4.6.  The answer to Exercise 9 should be 

          1   1   2                       1   1
   x(t) = - + -cos (t)      -or-   x(t) = - + -cos(2t)
          3   3                           2   6

   Also, the answers to 1, 7, and 11 look suspicious, but I have 
   not checked them specifically.
