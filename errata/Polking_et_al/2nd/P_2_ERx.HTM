   Unclear: "...the force is inversely proportional to but 
            opposite the square of the particle's displacement 
            from the origin." <br><br>

   Clear:   "...the magnitude of the force is inversely 
            proportional to the square of the particle's 
            displacement from the origin but the direction of the 
            force is opposite to the direction of the particle's 
            displacement from the origin."

   The statement, "When <i>s</i> < <i>a</i>, the exponent is 
   positive and so the term involving. . ." <br>
   is incorrect.<br><br> 

   The variables <i>s</i> and <i>a</i> are elements of the 
   complex numbers and thus cannot be simply related as less than 
   or greater than.  The sentence should read, "When <br>
   |<i>s</i>| < |<i>a</i>|, the term involving. . ."  This 
   problem persists throughout the chapter and in the solutions 
   given in the appendix.  In every case where something like 
   "provided <i>s</i> > <i>a</i>" is stated, it should be 
   "provided |s| > |a|.

Page A-10, Section 4.6. The answer to Exercise 9 </b><br>
   The given answer is incorrect.  The correct answer is:<br><br>
   
   <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>) = 
   (1/3) + (1/3)cos<sup>2</sup>(<i>t</i>)<br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or<br>

   <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>) = (1/2) + (1/6)cos(2<i>t</i>)<br><br>

   Also, the answers to 1, 7, and 11 look suspicious, but I have 
   not checked them specifically.
