   The statement, "When <i>s</i> &lt; <i>a</i>, the exponent is

   is incorrect.<br><br> 

   The variables <i>s</i> and <i>a</i> are elements of the 
   complex numbers and thus cannot be simply related as less than 
   or greater than.  The sentence should read, "When <br>
   Re{<i>s</i>} &lt; Re{<i>a</i>}, the term involving. . ."  This 
   problem persists throughout the chapter and in the solutions 
   given in the appendix.  In every case where something like,

   <i>Correct:</i>  "We want to interchange the order of integration in 
   (7.8).  In doing so the integral signs with their limits are 
   interchanged as well as the differential <i>du</i> and 
   <i>dt</i>.  After interchanging the order of integration, the 
   upper limit of the outer integral would be <i>t</i>, which was 
   the upper limit of the inner integral before changing the 
   order of integration.  Note however that after changing the 
   order of integration, <br> if <i>u</i> > <i>t</i> in the outer 
   integral, then <i>g</i>(<i>t</i> &ndash; <I>u</i>) = 0, (because 
   <i>g</i>(<i>x</i>) = 0 for all <i>x</i> < 0) therefore the 
   upper limit of the outer integral can be changed to <img 
   src="infinity.gif" alt="infinity">." <br><br> 

   Similarly, after changing the order of integration, the lower 
   limit of the inner integral should be 0, which was formerly the 
   lower limit of the outer integral.  However, the inner lower 
   limit can be changed to <i>u</i> since <i>g</i>(<i>t</i> 
   &ndash; <i>u</i>) = 0 for all <i>t</i> < <i>u</i>.<br><br> 
   
   <i>Remark:</i> The limits of integration in Definition 7.5 
   (about two inches from the top of page 234) are shown as 0 to 
   <i>t</i>.  This is only accurate when <i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) = 
   <i>g</i>(<i>t</i>) = 0 for all <i>t</i> < 0, as is assumed to 
   be the case in the context of the type of Laplace transforms 
   under discussion in this chapter.  A general definition 
   however has limits of <br>
   &ndash;<img src="infinity.gif" alt="infinity"> to <img 
   src="infinity.gif" alt="infinity">.  Then stipulate in Theorem 
   7.6 that the theorem only applies if<br> <i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) = 
   <i>g</i>(<i>t</i>) = 0 for all <i>t</i> < 0.  In this case the 
   inner integral in Equation 7.8 would have initially been 
   written with limits from &ndash;<img src="infinity.gif" 
   alt="infinity"> to <img src="infinity.gif" alt="infinity">.  Then 
   since <i>f</i>(<i>u</i>) = 0 for all<br> <i>u</i> < 0 the lower 
   limit of the inner integral can be changed to 0.  (The 
   upper limit of the inner integral then is <img 
   src="infinity.gif" alt="infinity"> with no further fuss.) 

<!--   Incorrect: In the equation at the bottom of page 235, the 
   lower limit of the inner integral is shown as "<i>u</i>". 
   <br><br> 

   Correct: The lower limit of this integral should be "0", as 
   shown in (7.8)<br>
   (At the bottom of the page the inner integral's lower limit 
   should be copied from the outer integral's lower limit in 
   equation 7.8, about 2 inches above.)

Page 235, About one inch from the top of the page</b><br>
   After the change of variable, the inside lower limit of the 
   first equation shown on the page should be "&ndash;<i>u</i>", 
   not "0".  However, since <i>g</i>(<i>v</i>) = 0 for all 
   <i>v</i> < 0, the lower limit of the inner integral can be 
   changed to 0.  Since this is a proof, the text should explain 
   this, not simply show it. -->

Page A-8, Section 4.1, Answer to Exercise 11</b> (from page

   The given answer is incorrect.  The correct answer is:<br>
   <br>
   2(kg)<I>y</I>" + 0.05(kg/s)<I>y</I>' + 39.2(kg/s<sup>2</sup>)<I>y</I> =

   19.6(kg m/s<sup>2</sup>){1 + sin[(<img src="pi.gif" 
   alt="pi"> rad/s)<I>t</I>]} <br>
   <br>
   The cos function is also acceptable in place of sin since 
   <BR>the problem only states "harmonic" motion.

   The given answer is incorrect.  The correct answer is:<br><br>
   
   <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>) = 
   (1/3) + (1/3)cos<sup>2</sup>(<i>t</i>)<br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

   <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>) = (1/2) + (1/6)cos(2<i>t</i>)<br><br>

   Also, the answers to 1, 7, and 11 look suspicious, but I have 
   not checked them specifically.
