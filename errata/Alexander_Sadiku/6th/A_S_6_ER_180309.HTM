If you are considering purchasing this textbook and worrying that 
it is a poor choice due to the length of this list of errata, please
don't worry about that.  Competing textbooks have about as many errata, but perhaps
no list like this.  "Better the devil you know than the devil you don't." 
Professor De Boer likes this book enough to find it worthwhile
to publish this list of errata.

   Also, an incorrect symbol for the make-before-break switch is 
   used in Figure 6.86 and the general order of flow of ideas from 
   right-to-left in the textbook's schematic is counter-intuitive.  
   A better schematic of the exact same circuit with a correct

       "Principal" is the wrong word here.  "Principle" was intended by the authors
       but the standards actually use the word "base."  Also as it stands in the text, 
       the poor grammar makes the number of base units ambiguous as either six or 
       seven.  Finally, "The SI units. . ." is a weak way to state the intention
       of this sentence. Most students would not comprehend the intent.
       (The SI base unit not mentioned in Table 1.1 is the mole.)

        If the current does not change with time, <del>but remains 
   constant, we call it a <i>direct current</i> (dc).</del> <ins>we 
   use a capital letter for the variable that represents it.  For 
   example, we might define a current, <i>I</i> to be five amperes by 
   writing <i>I</i> = 5 A.  If the current does vary with or depend 
   on time, we use a lower-case letter for its variable.  For example 
   we might define a current to be a sinusoid by writing 
   <i>i</i>(<i>t</i>) = 14.14cos(377<i>t</i>) A.  This is also done 
   with all other electrical quantities such as charge <i>Q</i> 
   versus, <i>q</i>(<i>t</i>), etc.

        There are various definitions of dc and ac in the literature.
        The definitions created by these corrections represent the more
        commonly found definitions.  A statement such as, "A rectifier
        converts ac to dc." is consistent with the definitions given by
        the corrections above, but not the uncorrected definitions in 
        the textbook.  (The "dc" current that flows out of a rectifier is 
        usually not constant with respect to time.  The waveform of the 
        "ac" current that flows into a rectifier is usually not sinusoidal.)  
        A direct current does not have to be a constant amount.  It may 
        pulsate or otherwise vary with time so long as it does not reverse 
        direction.<br><br>
        
        It is philosophically satisfying that we should be able to classify
        a current as either dc or ac.  The definitions in the textbook allow
        for currents that are neither dc or ac, for example, a triangle wave
        that oscillates between 1 A and &ndash;1 A. By allowing alternating 
        current to have any waveform and any period or no period (aperiodic) 
        so long as it changes direction from time to time, all currents can 
        then be classified as dc or ac.<br>

       The phrase, <i>neper frequency</i> is preferable for 
       naming the quantity denoted by &alpha; in this textbook.
       In addition to the definition of <i>damping factor</i> 
       implied in this textbook, the phrase <i>damping factor</i>
       has a plurality of other definitions applying in other 
       contexts.  For three unique examples see <a href=

               >page 506</a> of the textbook). Furthermore, 
       Prof. De Boer has not so far found any place where the 
       phrase <i>damping factor</i> is treated synonymously 
       with <i>neper frequency</i> except in undergraduate 
       circuits and linear systems textbooks or World Wide Web 
       pages intended for that same audience.  This limited 
       context is too narrow to justify introducing the phrase 
       <i>damping factor</i> here.

       A nearly similar term, <a href=
       "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping_ratio"><i>damping 
       ratio</i></a>, (not "factor") is uniformly well defined 
       in many contexts, including RLC circuits, but the neper 
       frequency (&alpha; in our textbook) and the damping 
       <i>ratio</i> are not the same thing.  Usually the damping
       ratio is represented by the variable &zeta; (zeta).  Using 
       our textbook's notation, the damping ratio would be defined 
       as &zeta;&nbsp;=&nbsp; &alpha;/&omega;<sub>o</sub>.  Since 
       most engineering students will encounter the term 
       <i>damping ratio</i> in their careers, the confusingly 
       similar name, <i>damping factor</i> (also known as 
       <i>damping attenuation factor</i>, <i>attenuation 
       factor</i>, and <i>damping coefficient</i>, etc.) should 
       not be introduced in the context of RLC circuits.  The 
       name <i>neper frequency</i> for &alpha; is more memorable, 
       more universal in the literature, and thus more helpful.<br>

        The words "capacitive" and "inductive" can be applied
        to an impedance, especially an impedance magnitude as in 
        part (d).  They can also be applied to the power factor 
        in lieu of "leading" and "lagging" respectively, but 
        these words are not correct with respect to reactive power.  
        <a target="_blank" href="XC_IS_NEG.HTM" >"Capacitive" 
        reactive power is always negative</a>.  Similarly, 
        "Inductive" reactive power is always positive.  Stating 
        a positive reactive power and calling it "capacitive" 
        is confusingly incorrect.  Similarly, the terms "leading"
        and "lagging" should not be used with respect to a quantified
        (numerically) reactive power either in lieu of or to augment 
        an algebraic sign.  ("Capacitively generated reactive power"
        is a meaningful statement however.  The word "Capacitively" 
        does not modify "reactive power" in this case.)<br>

   Both wye and delta connections have important practical applica-<br>

   <del>is due to the fact that the wye connection gives a line voltage that is &radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">3</span><br> 
   greater than the  delta connection, hence for the same power, the line<br>
   current is &radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">3</span> smaller.</del>
   
   <ins>A wye-connected source with an earth-grounded <br>
   neutral also allows the convenient use of single-phase appliances and <br>
   lights, which may then be connected from any one of the three phases<br> 
   to neutral.</ins> 
   In addition delta connected <ins> sources</ins> are also undesirable<br>
   due to the potential of having disastrous circulating currents.  <del>Sometimes, <br>
   using transformers, we create the equivalent of delta connect source. <br>
   This conversion from three-phase to single phase is required in residen-<br>
   tial wiring  because household lighting and appliances use single-phase<br>
   power.  Three-phase power is used in industrial wiring where a large <br>
   power is required.</del>  In <ins>most load</ins> <del>some</del> applications, it is immaterial whether the<br>
   load is wye- or delta-connected.  For example, both   connections are satisfac-<br>
   tory with induction motors.  <del>In fact, some manufacturers connect a motor <br>
   in delta for 220 V and in wye for 440 V so that one line of motors can be<br> 
   readily adapted to two different voltages.</del><br>

   Indeed, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup><i>R</i> loses need to be minimized for long-distance
   transmission of electric power.  And indeed, raising the voltage of a transmission 
   line by a factor of <span style="text-decoration: overline;">3</span> will decrease
   the current by that same factor and thus reduce losses.  However, these are not the reasons
   that wye-connected sources are usually preferred.  Given a particular desired line
   voltage and apparent power capability, the cost to manufacture a transformer to 
   drive that given transmission line will be about the same regardless of a wye or 
   delta-style connection.  (Wye-connected windings will have fewer turns but heavier 
   gauge compared to delta-connected windings of the same line-voltage and 
   apparent-power capabilities.)  The relevant issues are the possibility of 
   circulating currents in the delta connected source and the convenience and 
   safety of an earth-referenced neutral connection in the wye-connected source.<br><br>

    In some cases where an expression is integrated with respect to 
    time the same variable, <i>t</i>, is used as the variable of 
    integration and as the upper limit of the integral.  One variable 
    should not be used for two different quantities.  In these cases
    some other variable such as &lambda; should be substituted for 
    the variable of integration.  As an example, the first instance 
    of this error is in the <a href="#ERR_221">equations near the top
    of page 221</a>.  Some other instances of this error include:<br><br>

    Equations on pages, 229, (three instances), 231 (seven instances), 
    233, (four instances), 241 (four instances), 250 (two instances)   <br><br>

    Some other instances of this problem likely have not yet been 
    itemized in this errata sheet. Furthermore, in many cases where
    this situation arises and it is correctly handled, the authors 
    have used the variable &tau; as the variable of integration. 
    This invites confusion with the quantity known as a time constant, 
    also represented by &tau;. Readers need to understand that two 
    different quantities (variable of integration or time constant) 
    are denoted by &tau; in this textbook.  The meaning of &tau; 
    must be discerned by the reader from its context.

   Equation (11.5) can be further developed to show the 
   reactive power component.  As with the development of 
   Equation 11.5 in the textbook, this discussion and the 
   related definitions below assume the voltage and current 
   are sinusoidal.                                </span><br><br>
   
   Rearranging the second term in Eq. (11.5) to deliberately 
   itemize the angle (<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>), the same as in the first 
   term, gives
                                                         <br><br>
   <i>p</i>(<i>t</i>) = (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>
   cos(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>) + 
   (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>
   cos[(2<i>&omega;t</i> + 2<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>) &ndash; 
   (<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>)]                          <br><br>
   
   Now apply the trigonometric identity  
      cos(<i>&alpha;</i> &ndash; <i>&beta;</i>) =
   cos(<i>&alpha;</i>)cos(<i>&beta;</i>) +
   sin(<i>&alpha;</i>)sin(<i>&beta;</i>)                    <br>
   to the second term to get                                               <br><br>
   
   <i>p</i>(<i>t</i>) = (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>

   Associate the middle term above with the first term and 
   factor out amounts that are constant with respect to time.  
   The instantaneous power then is:                                                    <br><br>
   
   <i>p</i>(<i>t</i>) = (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>
   cos(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>)[1 +  
   cos(2<i>&omega;t</i> + 
   2<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>)] + 
                          <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
   (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>
   sin(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> 
   &ndash; <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>)sin(2<i>&omega;t</i> + 
   2<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>)]

   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
   (11.5b)                      <br><br> 
   
   The first term above in Eq. (11.5b) pulsates due to the 
   multiplicative term<br>
   [1 + cos(2<i>&omega;t</i> + 2<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>)]. 
   This multiplicative term has a maximum of 2, a minimum of 0,
   and an average of 1.  Importantly, it is never negative. 
   This means that the power represented by the first term 
   always represents the rate of actual work.  (Whether the work is absorbed
   or generated depends on the angle <i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i> and the sign convention associated 
   with the labels that define the polarities of <i>V<sub>m</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>m</sub></i>.)  Since the average of the 
   multiplicative term is 1, the coefficients on this 
   multiplicative term represent the average power, <i>P</i>.  This 
   represents the average rate of actual work.                          <br><br>   
   
   <i>P</i> = (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>
   cos(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>)                           <br><br>
   
   The above equation is identical to Eq. (11.8) on page 458 
   in the text.
                                                         <br><br>
   
   Turning our attention to the second term in Eq. (11.5b) notice
   that it's pulsation is represented by the multiplicative term,
   sin(2<i>&omega;t</i> + 2<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>)   This 
   multiplicative term varies both positive and negative as time varies.  This
   term has an average value of zero.  It represents power that 
   is surging back and forth
   as the algebraic sign of sin(2<i>&omega;t</i> + 2<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>) 
   oscillates. Thus this power does no useful work.  This second 
   term in Eq. (11.5b) is called the <i>instantaneous reactive 
   power</i>. Although at any instant there is an amount of power flow 
   related to this term, there is actually an amount of 
   energy that surges back and forth with each cycle of the alternating current.  
   The peak magnitude of the instantaneous reactive 
   power is proportional to the amount of energy that oscillates back and
   forth.  Thus the amount of reactive power is defined as the 
   peak of the instantaneous reactive power.  
   We use the variable <i>Q</i> to represent reactive power.  
   Reactive power is given the units of "volt-amperes reactive" 
   and is abbreviated as "VAR" or "VARs" (plural).  This 
   abbreviation is often pronounced as a word.  The peak 
   magnitude of the second term in Eq (11.5b) is         <br><br>
   
   <i>Q</i> = (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>
   sin(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>)                           <br><br>
   
   <font style="background-color:#EEF5f5;">DEFINITION:<i> 
   Reactive power</i> is the peak magnitude of power that surges 
   equally back and forth.  It has units of volt-amperes reactive 
   (VAR).</font>                                      <small><br>
   (This definition and the related discussion here are

   Now the instantaneous power, Eq. (11.5b), can be expressed in
   terms of the average power, <i>P</i>, and the reactive power, 
   <i>Q</i>.                                             <br><br>
   
   <i>p</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>P</i>[1 +  cos(2<i>&omega;t</i> + 
   2<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>)] + <i>Q</i>sin(2<i>&omega;t</i> + 
   2<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>)

   (11.5c)                      <br><br>
   
   In Section 11.4 of this textbook it is shown that     <br><br>
   
   <i>V<sub>rms</sub></i> = <i>V<sub>m</sub></i>/&radic;<span 
   style="text-decoration: overline;">2</span>
   and that 
   <i>I<sub>rms</sub></i> = <i>I<sub>m</sub></i>/&radic;<span 
   style="text-decoration: overline;">2</span><br><br>
   
   Applying these equalities gives.                      <br><br>
   
   <i>P</i> = <i>V<sub>rms</sub>I<sub>rms</sub></i>
   cos(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash;

   sin(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>)                           <br><br>
   
   The above equations match Eq. (11.50) on page 472 of the text.
                                                         <br><br>
   This illustrates the calculation of the average power and the 
   reactive power for sinusoidal currents and voltages.   
   The angle (<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>) recurs many times in discussions
   of AC circuits.  For this reason in most textbooks 
   and magazine articles it is simply denoted as <i>&theta;</i>.  
   This angle is given the name <i>power factor angle</i>.
                                                         <br><br>
   <font style="background-color:#EEF5f5;">DEFINITION: The

Page 469.  Eq 11.38a.              </b><br><span class="comment">
   This equation subtly introduces <i>phasors with RMS 
   magnitudes</i>.                                </span><br><br>
   
   In the power systems industry phasors are stated with RMS 
   magnitudes rather than peak magnitudes.  There are more 
   implications to this than first meets the eye.  In particular, 
   the phasor transform is modified so that the phasor magnitude 
   is in RMS units.  Up to this point in this textbook, all 
   phasor magnitudes have been peak magnitudes.  In 
   electronics work, peak magnitudes are usually used, but in 
   power systems work RMS magnitudes are usually used.   <br><br>
   
   Consider this electronics-style phasor transform having 
   peak magnitude.  This is the way the phasor transform 
   has been used for everything in this book up to this 
   point.<br>
   <i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = 14.14cos(<i>&omega;t</i> + 25&deg;) V
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&mdash;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>V</b> = 14.14/<u>25&deg;</u> V              <br><br>
   
   Now the very same function in a power systems-style phasor 
   transform will have an RMS magnitude.  This type of phasor 
   transform is used for everything from this point through 
   the end of Chapter 12.                                    <br>
   <i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = 14.14cos(<i>&omega;t</i> + 25&deg;) V
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&mdash;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>V</b><sub>rms</sub> = 
   10/<u>25&deg;</u> V<sub>RMS</sub>  <br><br>
   
   Just like it is fair to say that 1 foot = 12 inches, it is 
   also fair to say that <br>
   14.14/<u>25&deg;</u> V = 10/<u>25&deg;</u> V<sub>RMS</sub> 
   because of the different units employed.  And of course, 
   the inverse transform of either style phasor is 
   <i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = 14.14cos(<i>&omega;t</i> + 25&deg;) V.
                                                     <br><br>
   However in this textbook, and in the general literature 
   on power systems, the "RMS" subscript on the variable 
   <b><i>V</i></b><sub>rms</sub> and on the unit "volts RMS" is
   usually omitted.  The reader should understand that "unless
   otherwise stated" the units are RMS units when the context 
   is power systems.  For example consider Equation 11.41 on
   page 471.  The equation is <b>S</b> = 
   <b>V</b><sub>rms</sub><b>I*</b><sub>rms</sub>.
   The very same equation appears again in Equation 11.55 on 
   page 476, but now the subscripts are missing, 
   <b>S</b> = <b>V</b><b>I*</b>.
   It means exactly the same thing and the magnitudes of the 
   voltage and current phasors are still intended to be in RMS 
   units, even though the subscripts are missing, because it 
   occurs in the context of a chapter on electrical power 
   (not a chapter on radio circuits for example).       

<!--   Note also in passing that boldface denotes a phasor 
   (complex in general) and normal text denotes a real 
   number and that <i>V</i><sub>rms</sub> = 
   |<b>V</b><sub>rms</sub>|.  Similarly, 
   <i>S</i> = |<b>S</b>|.

   The phrases &quot;line voltage,&quot; &quot;line-to-line
   voltage,&quot; &quot;line-to-neutral voltage,&quot; 
   &quot;phase voltage,&quot; and similar terms for current such
   as, &quot;phase current,&quot; can become confusing.  Figure 
   12.14 can help us understand these.  (The Internet is often 
   unhelpful on the definitions of these terms since there are 
   many such definitions of dubious authority posted on the 
   Internet!) Here is a glossary of these terms with reference 
   to Figure 12.14 on page 510.<br><br></span><blockquote>
   
   <i>Voltage, line voltage, line-to-line voltage</i><br>
   In the context of a three phase circuit whenever &quot;voltage&quot;
   is mentioned with no other description it should be 
   assumed to be line-to-line voltage.  Also, &quot;line voltage"
   means "line-to-line voltage."  In Figure 12.14 
   <b>V</b><i><sub>ab</sub></i> is a line voltage.  Other line voltages 
   are <b>V</b><i><sub>bc</sub></i> and <b>V</b><i><sub>ca</sub></i>.
                                                          <br><br>
   <i>Line-to-neutral voltage</i><br>
   Just as the name says, any line to neutral.  Examples of 
   line-to-neutral voltages In Figure 14.10 are, 
   <b>V</b><i><sub>an</sub></i>, <b>V</b><i><sub>bn</sub></i> and 
   <b>V</b><i><sub>cn</sub></i>.<br><br>
   
   <i>Phase voltage</i><br>
   The word &quot;phase&quot; refers to a physical 1/3 of a source 
   or load.  A phase voltage is the voltage across a 1/3 section of 
   a source or load.  In order to understand if this is a 
   line-to-line voltage or a line-to-neutral voltage one needs to 
   know if the source or load in the present context is Y or &Delta; 
   connected.  In Figure 12.14, <b>V</b><i><sub>an</sub></i> is a 
   phase voltage for the source and <b>V</b><i><sub>bc</sub></i> is 
   a phase voltage for the load.  (There are many confusing definitions
   of &quot;phase voltage&quot; on the Internet.  In many cases these
   definitions happen to be in the context of a Y connection and they
   state only that phase voltage is a line-to-neutral voltage.  They 
   fail to mention that in the context of a &Delta; connection phase
   voltage is line-to-line voltage.  The explanation is correct in 
   its Y-connected context on the Web, but is incomplete for general use.)
                                                                <br><br>
   <i>Line current</i><br>
   Self explanatory.  In Figure 12.14 <b>I</b><i><sub>a</sub></i>, 
   <b>I</b><i><sub>b</sub></i>, and <b>I</b><i><sub>c</sub></i> are
   the line currents.<br><br>
   
   <i>Phase current</i><br>
   The word &quot;phase&quot; refers to a physical 1/3 of a source 
   or load.  A phase current is the current through a 1/3 section of 
   a source or load.  In order to understand if this is a 
   line current or something else one needs to know if the source or 
   load in the present context is Y or &Delta; connected.  In Figure 
   12.14, <b>I</b><i><sub>a</sub></i> is a phase current for the 
   source and <b>I</b><i><sub>AB</sub></i> is a phase current for 
   the load.  (There are many confusing definitions of &quot;phase 
   current&quot; on the Internet.  In many cases these definitions 
   happen to be in the context of a Y connection and they state only 
   that phase current is a line current.  They fail to mention that 
   in the context of a &Delta; connection phase current is something
   else.  The explanation is correct in its Y-connected context on 
   the Web, but is incomplete for general use.)

   In modern practice, the balanced wye connection is preferred 
   for most three-phase sources.  This is due to at least two factors.  
   First, a balanced wye connection creates a neutral (center 
   of the wye) that can be connected to earth for safety.  
   Providing the source with this safety connection simplifies 
   the design of other protection such as fusing.  
   (Providing a neutral for a delta-connected source is a much 
   more complicated matter.  See for example <a href=
   "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-leg_delta">here</a> and 
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigzag_transformer"
   >here</a> and <!-- <a href=
   "http://www.basler.com/downloads/ReviewOfSysGrounding.pdf"
   >--><a href =
   "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4515046/">here</a>.)  
   Secondly, 
   single-phase loads can be most easily connected to a 
   three-phase system by connecting them between any single line 
   and neutral, but a delta connection does not provide a 
   simple-to-use neutral for this purpose.  For this reason 
   three-phase 208 V<sub><small>RMS</small></sub> line-to-line 
   systems are popular in North American commercial buildings.  
   Then 120&nbsp;V<sub><small>RMS</small></sub> single-phase loads 
   are connected from line to neutral 
   (208/&radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">3</span>
   = 120).  Similarly in Europe and some other geographic locations 
   a 400 V<sub>RMS</sub> line-to-line three-phase power system 
   is used to provide 230 V<sub>RMS</sub> from any one line to 
   neutral.  Delta connected sources 
   are rarely specified for modern installations because any 
   slight imbalance between the three phases can cause 
   problematic circulating currents, and also because 
   protection devices (e.g. fuses) are more complicated to 
   use and maintain effectively.      <br><br>
   
   Circulating currents are not a problem in delta-connected 
   loads however, because each phase has appreciable 
   impedance so that it may absorb electrical power.  Delta 
   connected loads also operate at the full line-to-line 
   voltage which is &radic;<span style="text-decoration: 
   overline;">3</span> greater than the line-to-neutral 
   voltage.  This can economically reduce heating 
   (<i>I</i><sup><small>2</small></sup><i>R</i>) losses in 
   some practical situations.  If for some reason a 
   delta-connected load is slightly electrically unbalanced 
   (say one phase draws a bit more current than the others), 
   connecting it to a wye source distributes the unbalance 
   over two phases, making the system as a whole more balanced.  
   For these practical reasons delta connections are popular for 
   loads.  However, in theory it is immaterial if a load is wye 
   or delta connected. <br><br> 
   
   For example, either a wye or a delta connection is 
   satisfactory with induction motors.  Some induction motors 
   have terminal boards with six terminals, one for each end 
   of the three windings.  Then the customer can choose a wye 
   or delta connection.  In this way a manufacturer can offer 
   one line of motors to operate at two different voltages.  
   The higher rated voltage option will then be 
   &radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">3</span> 
   greater than the lower rated option.  For example 
   a motor might be rated for 277 delta/480 wye V<sub>RMS</sub>. 
   In this example the motor phases (coils) are designed to 
   operate at 277 V<sub>RMS</sub>.  The motor may be connected to a 
   277 V<sub>RMS</sub> line-to-line voltage system using a delta 
   connection which gives each phase (coil) 277 V<sub>RMS</sub>.  
   Alternatively, the same motor may be connected to a 
   480 V<sub>RMS</sub> line-to-line voltage system by using a 
   wye connection.  Then each phase (coil) will again be driven 
   with 277 V<sub>RMS</sub>.  Some of these motors are designed 
   to start with the wye connection and then, as the motor comes 
   up to speed, a set of relays switches it to the delta 
   connection to bring it to full power for normal running 
   conditions.  Connecting the example motor above for 
   wye-start-delta-run would require a 277 V<sub>RMS</sub> 
   line-to-line three-phase power source.  This starting method 
   minimizes voltage brown-outs in the power supply system when 
   the motor starts by minimizing the surge current needed to
   start the motor.
                                                          <br><br>   
   Other motors achieve a dual voltage rating by using dual windings
   for each of the three phases (six windings in total).  These 
   motors have terminal boards with nine terminals.  The 
   dual windings of each phase may then be connected in either 
   series or parallel.  Some connections are made inside the 
   motor by the manufacturer and are not accessible to the user.  
   These internal connections will make the motor connections 
   either wye or delta as prescribed by the manufacturer.  
   The customer will only have the choice of operating voltage, 
   not wye or delta connection.  The two voltage ratings will 
   differ by a factor of two, for example 
   240/480 V<sub>RMS</sub>.  The dual rating can also be used 
   on a power system corresponding to the lower voltage rating 
   to minimize the surge current needed to start the motor.  In 
   this case the motor is stared with the pairs of windings 
   connected in series.  Then, as the motor comes up to speed, 
   a set of relays reconnects the windings in parallel for 
   normal running.  This type of starting method generally
   provides more starting torque than the wye-start-delta-run 
   method.
                                                        <br><br>   
   Finally, some motors have dual windings and twelve terminals.
   These allow the customer up to four different operating 
   voltages by choosing combinations of series and parallel 
   windings and wye or delta connections.  This flexibility 
   may also be used to achieve a wye-start delta-run configuration
   at either of two voltage levels or a series-start-parallel-run 
   configuration, again at either of two voltages.

   The textbook's development of Equation 12.67 is unnecessarily 
   restricted to balanced loads.  In Figure 12.35 one may take 
   the load to be unbalanced.  Identify each phase with a 
   different load such as <b>Z</b><sub><i>Ya</i></sub>, 
   <b>Z</b><sub><i>Yb</i></sub>, 
   <b>Z</b><sub><i>Yc</i></sub> and assume that these are not 
   necessarily equal to each other.  Also consider node b (the 
   phase b line) to be the ground reference.  Now there are 
   effectively only two voltage sources driving the load, 
   <b>V</b><sub><i>ab</i></sub> and <b>V</b><sub><i>cb</i></sub> 
   as labeled in Figure 12.35.  Each wattmeter measures the 
   power supplied by one source.  Thus it is self-evident that 
   <i>P<sub>T</sub></i> = <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> + 
   <i>P</i><sub>2</sub>, even if the load is unbalanced.<br>

   Although an autotransformer is customarily thought of as a 
   transformer that employs one tapped winding as both the 
   primary and the secondary, it is not necessarily constructed
   this way.                                      </span><br><br>
   
   It can be helpful to think of an autotransformer as 
   an ordinary transformer that is used in a special type of 
   connection, the "autotransformer connection."  Any 
   transformer can be connected in an autotransformer 
   connection, assuming it has adequate insulation which is 
   usually the case.   Below, Figure 13.43 has been augmented 
   with part (c) to show how the transformer of part (a) can 
   be connected to perform identically to the autotransformer 
   of part (b).  
                                                         <br><br>
   When the voltage will be 
   autotransformed by a small amount, that is by a ratio that is 
   close to 1:1, then the turns ratio of the basic transformer, as 
   in part (a) of Figure 13.43, needs to be far from 1:1. In 
   this example the voltage transformation ratio is 20:21 and 
   the turns ratio is 20:1.  Then usually the winding with 
   fewer turns needs to be made of larger gauge wire in order
   to carry the correspondingly larger current.  Thus for the 
   maximum economic benefit, the autotransformer illustrated 
   in part (b) of the figure might actually be constructed from 
   two windings connected as in part (c).  This way the primary
   winding can be made from a thinner conductor since it does 
   not need to carry the full 4 A load current.  The transformer
   is still called an "autotransformer," as if it had only one 
   winding, because of the presence of the connection that places
   the two physical windings into one electrical winding with 
   a tap.
      <br><br>
   However, if the voltage transformation ratio is 1:2 then the 
   turns ratio of the transformer is 1:1.  This case is interesting
   because the current in each winding is identical in magnitude.  
   For example if the turns ratio of the transformer in part (a) 
   of the figure is changed to 1:1 then the secondary voltage 
   changes to 240 V and the secondary current changes to 0.2 A.  
   The transformer would be operating at <br>
   (240 V)(0.2 A) = 48 VA.  But, in the autotransformer 
   connection of part (c) the current flowing into the circuit from 
   the left would be 0.4 A.  This current would divide with 0.2 A 
   going into the primary winding and 0.2 A going into the lower 
   terminal of the secondary winding.  Each winding experiences 
   0.2 A in this case.  The net power delivered to the load would 
   be 480 V at 0.2 A or 96 VA, which is two times greater than 
   the transformer can handle when connected as a transformer.  
   This is the type of situation in which a true single winding 
   with a tap, as implied in the definition of an autotransformer, 
   is economic in terms of a savings of copper and iron, and 
   weight and size.  
                                                        <br><br>
   
   Regardless of the internal construction of an autotransformer
   (as truly one winding with a tap or as two physical windings 
   of different gauge conductors connected in series) the economic 
   advantages of an autotransformer are best realized when the 
   voltage transformation ratio is between 2:1 and 1:2.  When a 
   wider voltage transformation ratio is needed, at some point 
   the advantage of isolation that a standard transformer 
   connection has becomes compelling and the economic advantage
   of the autotransformer dwindles in comparison.  
                                                        <br><br>
