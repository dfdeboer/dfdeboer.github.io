   As electrical engineers, we must deal with measurable quantities.  Our mea-<br>
   surement, however, must be communicated in a standard language that <br>
   virtually all professionals can understand, irrespective of the country<br>
   where the measurement is conducted.  Such an international measurement<br>
   language is the International System of Units (SI), adopted by the<br>
   General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960.  In this system,<br>
   there are seven <ins>base</ins> units from which the units of all other phys-<br>
   ical quantities can be derived.  Table 1.1 shows <del>the</del> six <ins>base</ins> units and one<br> 
   derived unit <ins>(the coulomb)</ins> that are related to this text.  <del>The</del> SI units are 
   <del>used throughout this text</del> <ins> predominant in electrical engineering</ins>.  
                                <blockquote><small><span class=comment>
       "Principal" is the wrong word here.  "Principle" was intended by the authors
       but the standards actually use the word "base."  Also as it stands in the text, 
       the poor grammar makes the number of base units ambiguous as either six or 
       seven.  Also, "The SI units. . ." is a weak way to state the intention
       of this sentence. Most students would not comprehend the intent.
       (The SI base unit not mentioned in Table 1.1 is the mole.)

       The phrase, <i>neper frequency</i> is preferable for 
       naming the quantity denoted by &alpha; in this textbook.
       In addition to the definition of <i>damping factor</i> 
       implied in this textbook, the phrase <i>damping factor</i>
       has a plurality of other definitions applying in other 
       contexts.  For three unique examples see <a href=
       "http://www.rane.com/par-d.html">here</a> and 
       <a href="http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Newton's_method"
       >here (in "Variations and hybrid methods" section)</a> and 
       this <a href=
       "http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&itemId=0471401986&itemTypeId=BKS&bcsId=2155"
       >textbook</a> (See <a href=
       "http://books.google.com/books?id=nqoeAQAAIAAJ&dq=tongue+sheppard+dynamics&q=damping+factor#search_anchor"
               >page 506</a> of the textbook). Furthermore, 
       Prof. De Boer has not so far found any place where the 
       phrase <i>damping factor</i> is treated synonymously 
       with <i>neper frequency</i> except in undergraduate 
       circuits and linear systems textbooks or World Wide Web 
       pages intended for that same audience.  This limited 
       context is too narrow to justify introducing the phrase 
       <i>damping factor</i> here.

       A nearly similar term, <a href=
       "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping_ratio"><i>damping 
       ratio</i></a>, (not "factor") is uniformly well defined 
       in many contexts, including RLC circuits, but the neper 
       frequency (&alpha; in our textbook) and the damping 
       <i>ratio</i> are not the same thing.  Using our textbook's 
       notation, the damping ratio, &zeta;, would be defined as 
       &zeta;&nbsp;=&nbsp; &alpha;/&omega;<sub>o</sub>.  Since 
       most engineering students will encounter the term 
       <i>damping ratio</i> in their careers, the confusingly 
       similar name, <i>damping factor</i> (also known as 
       <i>damping attenuation factor</i>, <i>attenuation 
       factor</i>, and <i>damping coefficient</i>, etc.) should 
       not be introduced in the context of RLC circuits.  The 
       name <i>neper frequency</i> for &alpha; is more memorable, 
       more universal in the literature, and thus more helpful.<br>

Pages 534&ndash;535  First paragraph in Sec. 12.10.</b><br>
   The second, third, fourth, and fifth sentences of Section 
   12.10 contain errors.  Replace "The wye source connection is
   used for. . .   lighting and appliances use single-phase 
   power." with:                             <br><br><blockquote>

   The wye connection is commonly chosen for most sources.
   This is due to at least three factors.  First, there is a 
   neutral connection that can be connected to earth for safety.  
   Second the wye connection gives line voltages that are 
   a factor of the-square-root-of-three greater than a delta 
   connection gives.  In the case of long distance power 
   transmission, higher line voltages reduce the line currents 
   and consequently reduce the power losses caused by heating of 
   the conductors (<i>I</i><sup><small>2</small></sup><i>R</i>). 
   Third, with appropriate voltage levels, single-phase loads can 
   be connected to the three-phase system by connecting them 
   between any single line and neutral.  For example in North 
   America 208 V<sub><small>RMS</small></sub> line-to-line 
   three-phase systems are used to deliver  
   120&nbsp;V<sub><small>RMS</small></sub> from line to neutral.  
   Delta connected sources are rarely used because any slight 
   imbalance between the three phases can cause problematic 
   circulating currents.  (Circulating currents are not a problem 
   in delta-connected loads because each phase has appreciable 
   impedance so that it may absorb electrical power.)  Delta 
   connected sources also require considerably more complicated 
   protection (fuses, etc.) compared to wye connected sources.

In many cases where an expression is integrated with respect to 
time the same variable, <i>t</i>, is used as the variable of 
integration and as the upper limit of the integral.  One variable 
should not be used for two different quantities.  In these cases
some other variable such as &lambda; should be substituted for 
the variable of integration.  As an example, the first instance 
of this error is in <a href="#ERR_218">equation 6.5 on page

   Associate the middle term above with the first term and

   The first term above in Eq. (11.5b) represents the average 
   power. The pulsation of the average power is represented via 
   the time-varying multiplicative term, <br>
   [1 + cos(2<i>&omega;t</i> + <i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>)].  
   Note that this term varys between 0 and 2 as time varys.  
   It is never negative and has an average value of 1.  The 
   coefficient in front of it then must be the average power. 
                                                         <br><br>   
   <i>P</i> = (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>
   cos(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>)                           <br><br>
   
   The above equation is identical to Eq. (11.8) on page 460 
   in the text.
                                                         <br><br>
   
   Turning our attention to the second term in Eq. (11.5b) notice
   that it varys both positive and negative as time varys.  This
   term has an average value of zero.  It represents power that 
   is surging back and forth and doing no net work.  The second 
   term in Eq. (11.5b) is called the instantaneous reactive 
   power. The <i>peak magnitude of the power that surges back 
   and forth is defined as the amount of reactive power</i>.  
   We use the variable <i>Q</i> to represent reactive power.  
   Reactive power is given the units of "volt-amperes reactive" 
   and is abbreviated as "VAR" or "VARs" (plural).  This 
   abbreviation is often pronounced as a word.  The peak 
   magnitude of the second term in Eq (11.5b) is         <br><br>
   
   <i>Q</i> = (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>
   sin(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>)                           <br><br>
   
   <font style="background-color: yellow">DEFINITION:</font> <i>
   Reactive power</i> is the peak magnitude of power that surges 
   equally back and forth.  It has units of volt-amperes reactive 
   (VAR).                                                 <br><br>
   
   Now the instantanious power, Eq. (11.5b), can be expressed in
   terms of the average power, <i>P</i>, and the reactive power, 
   <i>Q</i>.                                             <br><br>
   
   <i>p</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>P</i>[1 +  cos(2<i>&omega;t</i> + 
   <i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>)] + <i>Q</i>sin(2(<i>&omega;t</i> +

   In Section 11.4 of this textbook it is shown that     <br><br>
   
   <i>V<sub>rms</sub></i> = <i>V<sub>m</sub></i>/(sqrt(2))
   and that 
   <i>I<sub>rms</sub></i> = <i>I<sub>m</sub></i>/(sqrt(2))<br><br>
   
   Applying these equalities gives.                      <br><br>
   
   <i>P</i> = <i>V<sub>rms</sub>I<sub>rms</sub></i>
   cos(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash;

   <i>Q</i> = <i>V<sub>rms</sub>I<sub>rms</sub></i>
   sin(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>)                           <br><br>
   
   The above equations match Eq. (11.50) on page 474 of the text.
                                                         <br><br>
   This illustrates the calculation of the average power and the 
   reactive power for sinusoidal currents and voltages.   
   The angle (<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>) recurrs many times in discussions
   of AC circuits.  For this reason in most textbooks 
   and magzine articles it is simply denoted as <i>&theta;</i>.  
   This angle is given the name <i>power factor angle</i>.
                                                         <br><br>
   <font style="background-color: yellow">DEFINITION:</font> 
   The <i>power factor angle</i> or more simply, the <i>power
   angle</i> is by definition <i>&theta;</i> = 
   (<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>).                          <br><br>
   
   Using this definition, Eq. 11.50 on page 474 can be reduced to
                                                         <br><br>

   This equation subtly introduces a very important issue.
   In the power systems industry phasors are stated with RMS 
   magnitudes rather than peak magnitudes.  There are more 
   implications to this than first meets the eye.  In 
   particular, the phasor transform is modified so that the 
   phasor magnitude is in RMS units.  Up to this point in this 
   textbook, all phasor magnitudes have been peak magnitudes.  
   In electronics work, peak magnitudes are usually used, but 
   in power systems work RMS magnitudes are usually used.  
   <br><br>
   
   Consider this electronics-style phasor transform having 
   peak magnitude, used for everything in this book up to 
   this point<br>
   <i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = 14.14cos(<i>&omega;t</i> + 25&deg;) V
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&mdash;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b><i>V</i></b> = 14.14/<u>25&deg;</u> V              <br><br>
   
   Now the very same function in a power systems-style phasor 
   transform will have an RMS magnitude.  This type of phasor 
   transform is used for everything from this point through 
   the end of Chapter 12.                                    <br>
   <i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = 14.14cos(<i>&omega;t</i> + 25&deg;) V
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&mdash;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b><i>V</i></b><sub>rms</sub> = 
   10/<u>25&deg;</u> V<sub>RMS</sub>  <br><br>
   
   Just like it is fair to say that 1 foot = 12 inches, it is 
   also fair to say that <br>
   14.14/<u>25&deg;</u> V = 10/<u>25&deg;</u> V<sub>RMS</sub> 
   because of the different units employed.  And of course, 
   the inverse transform of either phasor is 
   <i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = 14.14cos(<i>&omega;t</i> + 25&deg;) V.
                                                     <br><br>
   However in this textbook, and in the general literature 
   on power systems, the "RMS" subscript on the variable 
   <b><i>V</i></b><sub>rms</sub> and on the unit "volts RMS" is
   usually omitted.  The reader should understand that "unless
   otherwise stated" the units are RMS units when the context 
   is power systems.  For example consider Equation 11.41 on
   page 473.  The equation is <i><b>S</b></i> = 
   <i><b>V</b></i><sub>rms</sub><i><b>I*</b></i><sub>rms</sub>.
   The very same equation appears again in Equation 11.55 on 
   page 478, but now the subscripts are missing, 
   <i><b>S</b></i> = <i><b>V</b></i><i><b>I*</b></i>.
   It means exactly the same thing and the magnitudes of the 
   voltage and current phasors are still intended to be in RMS 
   units even though the subscripts are missing.       <br><br>
   
   Note also in passing that boldface denotes a phasor 
   (complex in general) and normal text denotes a real 
   number and that <i>V</i><sub>rms</sub> = 
   |<b><i>V</i></b><sub>rms</sub>|.

   Any transformer can be connected as an autotransformer, 
   assming it has adequate insulation which is usually the case.
   Figure 13.43 has been augmented with part (c) in the

   can be connected to perform identically to the
