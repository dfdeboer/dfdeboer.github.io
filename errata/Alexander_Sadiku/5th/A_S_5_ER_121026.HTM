   As electrical engineers, we must deal with measurable quantities.  Our mea-<br>
   surements, however, must be communicated in a standard language that<br>
   virtually all professionals can understand, irrespective of the country<br>
   where the measurement is conducted.  Such an international measurement<br>
   language is the International System of Units (SI), adopted by the<br>
   General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960.  In this system,<br>
   there are seven <del>principal</del> <ins>base</ins> units from which the units of all other phys-<br>
   ical quantities can be derived.  Table 1.1 shows <del>the</del> six <ins>base</ins> units and one<br>
   derived unit <ins>(the coulomb)</ins> that are related to this text.  <del>The</del> SI units are<br>
   <del>used throughout this text</del> <ins> commonly used in electrical engineering</ins>.

       "Principal" is the wrong word here.  "Principle" was intended by the authors
       but the standards actually use the word "base."  Also as it stands in the text, 
       the poor grammar makes the number of base units ambiguous as either six or 
       seven.  Finally, "The SI units. . ." is a weak way to state the intention
       of this sentence. Most students would not comprehend the intent.
       (The SI base unit not mentioned in Table 1.1 is the mole.)

   Both of these definitions are overly restrictive. Additionally, 
   the text around them conflates the concept of a <i>constant current</i> 
   versus a <i>time-varying current</i> with the concepts of dc versus ac.  
   Correct the surrounding text and the definitions, starting with 
   the paragraph that begins with, "If the current does not change. . ." 
                          </span><br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        If the current does not change with time, <del>but remains 
   constant, we call it a <i>direct current</i> (dc).</del> <ins>we 
   use a capital letter for the variable that represents it.  For 
   example, we might define a current, <i>I</i> to be five amperes by 
   writing <i>I</i> = 5 A.  If the current does vary with or depend 
   on time, we use a lower-case letter for its variable.  For example 
   we might define a current to be a sinusoid by writing 
   <i>i</i>(<i>t</i>) = 14.14cos(377<i>t</i>) A.  This is also done 
   with all other electrical quantities such as charge <i>Q</i> 
   versus, <i>q</i>(<i>t</i>), etc.  
                                  <br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Current can also be classified as <i>direct</i> or 
   <i>alternating</i>.</ins>

        <ins>Direct current could be time-varying.  For example, 
   <i>i</i>(<i>t</i>) = &ndash;|3cos(377<i>t</i>)| A <br>
   is a direct current 
   because it never changes sign, indicating that it never reverses <br>
   direction.                                  </ins><br><br><del>
   
   By convention the symbol <i>I</i> is used to represent such a constant current.
                                           <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
         A time-varying curer is represented by the symbol <i>i</i>.  A common<br>
   form of time-varying current is the sinusoidal current or <i>alternating</i>
   <i>current</i> (ac).</del>
   <br><br><span style="background-color:#EEF5f5; font-family:ariel, sans-serif;">

   Such current is used in your household, to run the air conditioner,<br>
   refrigerator, washing machine, and other electric appliances.  Figure 1.4
                        <span class=comment><blockquote><small>
        There are various definitions of dc and ac in the literature.
        The definitions created by these corrections represent the more
        commonly found definitions.  A statement such as, "A rectifier
        converts ac to dc." is consistent with the definitions given by
        the corrections above, but not the uncorrected definitions in 
        the textbook.  (The "dc" current that flows out of a rectifier is 
        usually not constant with respect to time.  The waveform of the 
        "ac" current that flows into a rectifier is usually not sinusoidal.)  
        A direct current does not have to be a constant amount.  It may 
        pulsate or otherwise vary with time so long as it does not reverse 
        direction.<br><br>
        
        It is philosophically satisfying that we should be able to classify
        a current as either dc or ac.  The definitions in the textbook allow
        for currents that are neither dc or ac, for example, a triangle wave
        that oscillates between 1 A and &ndash;1 A. By allowing alternating 
        current to have any waveform and any period or no period (aperiodic) 
        so long as it changes direction from time to time, all currents can 
        then be classified as dc or ac.<br>

       Prof. De Boer has not so far found any place where the 
       phrase <i>damping factor</i> is treated synonymously 
       with <i>neper frequency</i> except in undergraduate 
       circuits and linear systems textbooks or World Wide Web 
       pages intended for that same audience.  This limited 
       context is too narrow to justify introducing the phrase 
       <i>damping factor</i> here.

       A nearly similar term, <a href=
       "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping_ratio"><i>damping 
       ratio</i></a>, (not "factor") is uniformly well defined 
       in many contexts, including RLC circuits, but the neper 
       frequency (&alpha; in our textbook) and the damping 
       <i>ratio</i> are not the same thing.  Usually the damping
       ratio is represented by the variable &zeta; (zeta).  Using 
       our textbook's notation, the damping ratio would be defined 
       as &zeta;&nbsp;=&nbsp; &alpha;/&omega;<sub>o</sub>.  Since 
       most engineering students will encounter the term 
       <i>damping ratio</i> in their careers, the confusingly 
       similar name, <i>damping factor</i> (also known as 
       <i>damping attenuation factor</i>, <i>attenuation 
       factor</i>, and <i>damping coefficient</i>, etc.) should 
       not be introduced in the context of RLC circuits.  The 
       name <i>neper frequency</i> for &alpha; is more memorable, 
       more universal in the literature, and thus more helpful.<br>

        The words "capacitive" and "inductive" can be applied
        to an impedance, especially an impedance magnitude as in 
        part (d).  They can also be applied to the power factor 
        in lieu of "leading" and "lagging" respectively, but 
        these words are not correct with respect to reactive power.  
        <a target="_blank" href="XC_IS_NEG.HTM" >"Capacitive" 
        reactive power is always negative</a>.  Similarly, 
        "Inductive" reactive power is always positive.  Stating 
        a positive reactive power and calling it "capacitive" 
        is confusingly incorrect.  Similarly, the terms "leading"
        and "lagging" should not be used with respect to a quantified
        (numerically) reactive power either in lieu of or to augment 
        an algebraic sign.  ("Capacitively generated reactive power"
        is a meaningful statement however.  The word "Capacitively"

   Add dots near the top of each coil (four instances) to show 
   flux polarity. (Voltage labels do not indicate flux polarity. 
   They indicate voltage!)  A corrected illustration is shown below.

   In an autotransformer connection correct flux linkage depends
   importantly on flux polarities.  The illustrations need to 
   have dots added to the transformer windings to show flux 
   polarities even though in this case all the "+" marks 
   coincidentally correspond to places where a dot is needed.

    In some cases where an expression is integrated with respect to 
    time the same variable, <i>t</i>, is used as the variable of 
    integration and as the upper limit of the integral.  One variable 
    should not be used for two different quantities.  In these cases
    some other variable such as &lambda; should be substituted for 
    the variable of integration.  As an example, the first instance 
    of this error is in the <a href="#ERR_221">equations near the top
    of page 221</a>.  Some other instances of this error include:<br><br>

    Equations on pages, 229, (three instances), 231 (seven instances),

    Some other instances of this problem likely have not yet been 
    itemized in this errata sheet. Furthermore, in many cases where
    this situation arises and it is correctly handled, the authors 
    have used the variable &tau; as the variable of integration. 
    This invites confusion with the quantity known as a time constant, 
    also represented by &tau;. Readers need to understand that two 
    different quantities (variable of integration or time constant) 
    are denoted by &tau; in this textbook.  The meaning of &tau; 
    must be discerned by the reader from its context.

   Equation (11.5) can be further developed to show the 
   reactive power component.  As with the development of 
   Equation 11.5 in the textbook, this discussion and the 
   related definitions below assume the voltage and current 
   are sinusoidal.                                </span><br><br>
   
   Rearranging the second term in Eq. (11.5) to deliberately 
   itemize the angle (<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>), the same as in the first 
   term, gives
                                                         <br><br>
   <i>p</i>(<i>t</i>) = (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>
   cos(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>) + 
   (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>
   cos[(2<i>&omega;t</i> + 2<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>) &ndash; 
   (<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>)]                          <br><br>
   
   Now apply the trigonometric identity  
      cos(<i>&alpha;</i> &ndash; <i>&beta;</i>) =
   cos(<i>&alpha;</i>)cos(<i>&beta;</i>) +
   sin(<i>&alpha;</i>)sin(<i>&beta;</i>)                    <br>
   to the second term to get                                               <br><br>
   
   <i>p</i>(<i>t</i>) = (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>

   Associate the middle term above with the first term and 
   factor out amounts that are constant with respect to time.  
   The instantaneous power then is:                                                    <br><br>

   (11.5b)                      <br><br> 
   
   The first term above in Eq. (11.5b) pulsates due to the 
   multiplicative term<br>
   [1 + cos(2<i>&omega;t</i> + 2<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>)]. 
   This multiplicative term has a maximum of 2, a minimum of 0,
   and an average of 1.  Importantly, it is never negative. 
   This means that the power represented by the first term 
   always represents the rate of actual work.  (Whether the work is absorbed
   or generated depends on the angle <i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i> and the sign convention associated 
   with the labels that define the polarities of <i>V<sub>m</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>m</sub></i>.)  Since the average of the 
   multiplicative term is 1, the coefficients on this 
   multiplicative term represent the average power, <i>P</i>.  This 
   represents the average rate of actual work.                          <br><br>   
   
   <i>P</i> = (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>
   cos(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>)                           <br><br>
   
   The above equation is identical to Eq. (11.8) on page 460 
   in the text.
                                                         <br><br>
   
   Turning our attention to the second term in Eq. (11.5b) notice
   that it's pulsation is represented by the multiplicative term,
   sin(2<i>&omega;t</i> + 2<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>)   This 
   multiplicative term varys both positive and negative as time varys.  This
   term has an average value of zero.  It represents power that 
   is surging back and forth
   as the algebraic sign of sin(2<i>&omega;t</i> + 2<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>) 
   oscillates. Thus this power does no useful work.  This second 
   term in Eq. (11.5b) is called the <i>instantaneous reactive 
   power</i>. Although at any instant there is an amount of power flow 
   related to this term, there is actually an amount of 
   energy that surges back and forth with each cycle of the alternating current.  
   The peak magnitude of the instantaneous reactive 
   power is proportional to the amount of energy that oscillates back and
   forth.  Thus the amount of reactive power is defined as the 
   peak of the instantaneous reactive power.  
   We use the variable <i>Q</i> to represent reactive power.  
   Reactive power is given the units of "volt-amperes reactive" 
   and is abbreviated as "VAR" or "VARs" (plural).  This 
   abbreviation is often pronounced as a word.  The peak 
   magnitude of the second term in Eq (11.5b) is         <br><br>
   
   <i>Q</i> = (1/2)<i>V<sub>m</sub>I<sub>m</sub></i>
   sin(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>)                           <br><br>
   
   <font style="background-color: yellow">DEFINITION:</font> <i>
   Reactive power</i> is the peak magnitude of power that surges 
   equally back and forth.  It has units of volt-amperes reactive 
   (VAR).                                             <small><br>
   (This definition and the related discussion here are 
   valid for single-phase systems with sinusoidal voltages and

   Now the instantaneous power, Eq. (11.5b), can be expressed in
   terms of the average power, <i>P</i>, and the reactive power, 
   <i>Q</i>.                                             <br><br>
   
   <i>p</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>P</i>[1 +  cos(2<i>&omega;t</i> +

   2<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i>)

   (11.5c)                      <br><br>
   
   In Section 11.4 of this textbook it is shown that     <br><br>
   
   <i>V<sub>rms</sub></i> = <i>V<sub>m</sub></i>/&radic;<span 
   style="text-decoration: overline;">2</span>
   and that 
   <i>I<sub>rms</sub></i> = <i>I<sub>m</sub></i>/&radic;<span 
   style="text-decoration: overline;">2</span><br><br>
   
   Applying these equalities gives.                      <br><br>
   
   <i>P</i> = <i>V<sub>rms</sub>I<sub>rms</sub></i>
   cos(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash;

   sin(<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>)                           <br><br>
   
   The above equations match Eq. (11.50) on page 474 of the text.
                                                         <br><br>
   This illustrates the calculation of the average power and the 
   reactive power for sinusoidal currents and voltages.   
   The angle (<i>&theta;<sub>v</sub></i> &ndash; 
   <i>&theta;<sub>i</sub></i>) recurs many times in discussions
   of AC circuits.  For this reason in most textbooks 
   and magazine articles it is simply denoted as <i>&theta;</i>.  
   This angle is given the name <i>power factor angle</i>.
                                                         <br><br>
   <font style="background-color: yellow">DEFINITION:</font>

   This equation subtly introduces <i>phasors with RMS 
   magnitudes</i>.                                </span><br><br>
   
   In the power systems industry phasors are stated with RMS 
   magnitudes rather than peak magnitudes.  There are more 
   implications to this than first meets the eye.  In particular, 
   the phasor transform is modified so that the phasor magnitude 
   is in RMS units.  Up to this point in this textbook, all 
   phasor magnitudes have been peak magnitudes.  In 
   electronics work, peak magnitudes are usually used, but in 
   power systems work RMS magnitudes are usually used.   <br><br>
   
   Consider this electronics-style phasor transform having 
   peak magnitude.  This is way the the phasor transform 
   has been used for everything in this book up to this 
   point.<br>
   <i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = 14.14cos(<i>&omega;t</i> + 25&deg;) V
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&mdash;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>V</b> = 14.14/<u>25&deg;</u> V              <br><br>
   
   Now the very same function in a power systems-style phasor 
   transform will have an RMS magnitude.  This type of phasor 
   transform is used for everything from this point through 
   the end of Chapter 12.                                    <br>
   <i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = 14.14cos(<i>&omega;t</i> + 25&deg;) V
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&mdash;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>V</b><sub>rms</sub> = 
   10/<u>25&deg;</u> V<sub>RMS</sub>  <br><br>
   
   Just like it is fair to say that 1 foot = 12 inches, it is 
   also fair to say that <br>
   14.14/<u>25&deg;</u> V = 10/<u>25&deg;</u> V<sub>RMS</sub> 
   because of the different units employed.  And of course, 
   the inverse transform of either style phasor is 
   <i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = 14.14cos(<i>&omega;t</i> + 25&deg;) V.
                                                     <br><br>
   However in this textbook, and in the general literature 
   on power systems, the "RMS" subscript on the variable 
   <b><i>V</i></b><sub>rms</sub> and on the unit "volts RMS" is
   usually omitted.  The reader should understand that "unless
   otherwise stated" the units are RMS units when the context 
   is power systems.  For example consider Equation 11.41 on
   page 473.  The equation is <b>S</b> = 
   <b>V</b><sub>rms</sub><b>I*</b><sub>rms</sub>.
   The very same equation appears again in Equation 11.55 on 
   page 478, but now the subscripts are missing, 
   <b>S</b> = <b>V</b><b>I*</b>.
   It means exactly the same thing and the magnitudes of the 
   voltage and current phasors are still intended to be in RMS 
   units, even though the subscripts are missing, because it 
   occurs in the context of a chapter on electrical power 
   (not a chapter on radio circuits for example).       
                                                       <br><br>
   
   Note also in passing that boldface denotes a phasor 
   (complex in general) and normal text denotes a real 
   number and that <i>V</i><sub>rms</sub> = 
   |<b>V</b><sub>rms</sub>|.  Similarly, 
   <i>S</i> = |<b>S</b>|.

   The first paragraph in Section 12.10 of the textbook contains 
   some <a href="#ERR_534">errors of substance</a> and some poor 
   grammar.  Several paragraphs of replacement text are offered 
   here.  This replacement corrects the errors and offers a more 
   complete explanation of the several issues the textbook's 
   paragraph touches on.

   In modern practice, the balanced wye connection is preferred 
   for most sources.  This is due to at least three factors.  
   First, a balanced wye connection creates a neutral (center 
   of the wye) that can be connected to earth for safety.  
   Providing the source with this safety connection simplifies 
   the design of other protection such as fusing.  
   (Providing a neutral for a delta-connected source is a much 
   more complicated matter.  See for example <a href=
   "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-leg_delta">here</a> and 
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigzag_transformer"
   >here</a> and <a href=
   "http://www.basler.com/downloads/ReviewOfSysGrounding.pdf"
   >here</a>.)  
   Secondly, 
   single-phase loads can be most easily connected to a 
   three-phase system by connecting them between any single line 
   and neutral, but a delta connection does not provide a 
   simple-to-use neutral for this purpose.  For this reason 
   three-phase 208 V<sub><small>RMS</small></sub> line-to-line 
   systems are popular in North American commercial buildings.  
   Then 120&nbsp;V<sub><small>RMS</small></sub> single-phase loads 
   are connected from line to neutral 
   (208/&radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">3</span>
   = 120).  Similarly in Europe and some other geographic locations 
   a 400 V<sub>RMS</sub> line-to-line three-phase power system 
   is used to provide 230 V<sub>RMS</sub> from any one line to 
   neutral.  Thirdly, connecting a given set of windings in a 
   three-phase source in a wye connection gives line voltages 
   that are a factor of 
   &radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">3</span> 
   greater than a delta connection would give.  In the case of 
   long distance power transmission, higher line voltages reduce 
   the line currents and consequently reduce the power losses 
   (<i>I</i><sup><small>2</small></sup><i>R</i>) 
   caused by heating of the conductors. Delta connected sources 
   are rarely specified for modern installations because any 
   slight imbalance between the three phases can cause 
   problematic circulating currents, and also because 
   protection devices (e.g. fuses) are more complicated to 
   use and maintain effectively.      <br><br>
   
   Circulating currents are not a problem in delta-connected 
   loads however, because each phase has appreciable 
   impedance so that it may absorb electrical power.  Delta 
   connected loads also operate at the full line-to-line 
   voltage which is &radic;<span style="text-decoration: 
   overline;">3</span> greater than the line-to-neutral 
   voltage.  This can economically reduce heating 
   (<i>I</i><sup><small>2</small></sup><i>R</i>) losses in 
   some practical situations.  If for some reason a 
   delta-connected load is slightly electrically unbalanced 
   (say one phase draws a bit more current than the others), 
   connecting it to a wye source distributes the unbalance 
   over two phases, making the system as a whole more balanced.  
   For these practical reasons delta connections are popular for 
   loads.  However, in theory it is immaterial if a load is wye 
   or delta connected. <br><br> 
   
   For example, either a wye or a delta connection is 
   satisfactory with induction motors.  Some induction motors 
   have terminal boards with six terminals, one for each end 
   of the three windings.  Then the customer can choose a wye 
   or delta connection.  In this way a manufacturer can offer 
   one line of motors to operate at two different voltages.  
   The higher rated voltage option will then be 
   &radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">3</span> 
   greater than the lower rated option.  For example 
   a motor might be rated for 277 delta/480 wye V<sub>RMS</sub>. 
   In this example the motor phases (coils) are designed to 
   operate at 277 V<sub>RMS</sub>.  The motor may be connected to a 
   277 V<sub>RMS</sub> line-to-line voltage system using a delta 
   connection which gives each phase (coil) 277 V<sub>RMS</sub>.  
   Alternatively, the same motor may be connected to a 
   480 V<sub>RMS</sub> line-to-line voltage system by using a 
   wye connection.  Then each phase (coil) will again be driven 
   with 277 V<sub>RMS</sub>.  Some of these motors are designed 
   to start with the wye connection and then, as the motor comes 
   up to speed, a set of relays switches it to the delta 
   connection to bring it to full power for normal running 
   conditions.  Connecting the example motor above for 
   wye-start-delta-run would require a 277 V<sub>RMS</sub> 
   line-to-line three-phase power source.  This starting method 
   minimizes voltage brown-outs in the power supply system when 
   the motor starts by minimizing the surge current needed to
   start the motor.
                                                          <br><br>   
   Other motors achieve a dual voltage rating by using dual windings
   for each of the three phases (six windings in total).  These 
   motors have terminal boards with nine terminals.  The 
   dual windings of each phase may then be connected in either 
   series or parallel.  Some connections are made inside the 
   motor by the manufacturer and are not accessible to the user.  
   These internal connections will make the motor connections 
   either wye or delta as prescribed by the manufacturer.  
   The customer will only have the choice of operating voltage, 
   not wye or delta connection.  The two voltage ratings will 
   differ by a factor of two, for example 
   240/480 V<sub>RMS</sub>.  The dual rating can also be used 
   on a power system corresponding to the lower voltage rating 
   to minimize the surge current needed to start the motor.  In 
   this case the motor is stared with the pairs of windings 
   connected in series.  Then, as the motor comes up to speed, 
   a set of relays reconnects the windings in parallel for 
   normal running.  This type of starting method generally
   provides more starting torque than the wye-start-delta-run 
   method.
                                                        <br><br>   
   Finally, some motors have dual windings and twelve terminals.
   These allow the customer up to four different operating 
   voltages by choosing combinations of series and parallel 
   windings and wye or delta connections.  This flexibility 
   may also be used to achieve a wye-start delta-run configuration
   at either of two voltage levels or a series-start-parallel-run 
   configuration, again at either of two voltages.

   Although an autotransformer is customarily thought of as a 
   transformer that employs one tapped winding as both the 
   primary and the secondary, it is not necessarily constructed
   this way.                                      </span><br><br>
   
   It can be helpful to think of an autotransformer as 
   an ordinary transformer that is used in a special type of 
   connection, the "autotransformer connection."  Any 
   transformer can be connected in an autotransformer 
   connection, assuming it has adequate insulation which is 
   usually the case.   Below, Figure 13.43 has been augmented 
   with part (c) to show how the transformer of part (a) can 
   be connected to perform identically to the autotransformer 
   of part (b).  
                                                         <br><br>
   When the voltage will be 
   autotransformed by a small amount, that is by a ratio that is 
   close to 1:1, then the turns ratio of the basic transformer, as 
   in part (a) of Figure 13.43, needs to be far from 1:1. In 
   this example the voltage transformation ratio is 20:21 and 
   the turns ratio is 20:1.  Then usually the winding with 
   fewer turns needs to be made of larger gauge wire in order
   to carry the correspondingly larger current.  Thus for the 
   maximum economic benefit, the autotransformer illustrated 
   in part (b) of the figure might actually be constructed from 
   two windings connected as in part (c).  This way the primary
   winding can be made from a thinner conductor since it does 
   not need to carry the full 4 A load current.  The transformer
   is still called an "autotransformer," as if it had only one 
   winding, because of the presence of the connection that places
   the two physical windings into one electrical winding with 
   a tap.
      <br><br>
   However, if the voltage transformation ratio is 1:2 then the 
   turns ratio of the transformer is 1:1.  This case is interesting
   because the current in each winding is identical in magnitude.  
   For example if the turns ratio of the transformer in part (a) 
   of the figure is changed to 1:1 then the secondary voltage 
   changes to 240 V and the secondary current changes to 0.2 A.  
   The transformer would be operating at <br>
   (240 V)(0.2 A) = 48 VA.  But, in the autotransformer 
   connection of part (c) the current flowing into the circuit from 
   the left would be 0.4 A.  This current would divide with 0.2 A 
   going into the primary winding and 0.2 A going into the lower 
   terminal of the secondary winding.  Each winding experiences 
   0.2 A in this case.  The net power delivered to the load would 
   be 480 V at 0.2 A or 96 VA, which is two times greater than 
   the transformer can handle when connected as a transformer.  
   This is the type of situation in which a true single winding 
   with a tap, as implied in the definition of an autotransformer, 
   is economic in terms of a savings of copper and iron, and 
   weight and size.  
                                                        <br><br>
   
   Regardless of the internal construction of an autotransformer
   (as truly one winding with a tap or as two physical windings 
   of different gauge conductors connected in series) the economic 
   advantages of an autotransformer are best realized when the 
   voltage transformation ratio is between 2:1 and 1:2.  When a 
   wider voltage transformation ratio is needed, at some point 
   the advantage of isolation that a standard transformer 
   connection has becomes compelling and the economic advantage
   of the autotransformer dwindles in comparison.  
                                                        <br><br>
