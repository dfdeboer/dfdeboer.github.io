          N. Sadiku's <em>Fundamentals of Electric Circuits</em> (4th edition)<!-- #EndEditable --></h3> 
          This list was prepared by <a href="http://people.sinclair.edu/nickreeder/"
          >Prof. Nick Reeder</a> at Sinclair Community College, Dayton Ohio, 
          for the 5th edition in about December of 2014.  Prof. De Boer (Dordt College, Sioux Center, Iowa) 
          has adapted it for the 4th edition by changing a few numbers to match the 4th edition and 
          removing errata that is unique to the 5th edition.

          <p><strong>In addition to the errors listed in the author's official list</strong>, here are typos that
            I [Prof. Reeder] have found in the book: </p>
          <p>p. 10, fourth line before Section 1.5: &quot;represented by V&quot; should
          be &quot;represented by <em>V</em>.&quot; (V should be in italics.)</p>
          <p>p. 112, last line before Method 2: &quot;-<em>v<sub>o</sub></em> +<sup>1</sup>k<em>I</em><sub>3</sub>&quot; should
              be &quot;-<em>v<sub>o</sub></em> +1k<em>I</em><sub>3</sub>.&quot;  (1
              should not be superscripted.)</p>
            <p>p. 130, fifth line of Section 4.3: &quot;known as the <em>superposition</em>&quot; should
              be &quot;known as the <em>superposition principle</em>.&quot;</p>
            <p>p. 134, first line of Example 4.5: &quot;use the superposition
                theorem"
              should
              be &quot;use the superposition principle.&quot;</p>
            <p>p. 143, second-to-last line: &quot;you will not have a value for
              <em>V</em><sub>Th</sub>" should
            be &quot;<em>V</em><sub>Th</sub> will
            have a value of 0.&quot;</p>
            <p>p. 148, sixth line of Solution to Example 4.12: &quot;1<em>v</em> /
              5&Omega;&quot;
              should be &quot;1V / 5&Omega;.&quot; (V should be upper-case and
              non-italics.)</p>
            <p>p. 201, Review Question 5.5: The units on all answers should &micro;A
              be instead of mA.</p>
            <p>p. 229, third line of Example 6.9: &quot;Assume
              <em>i(v)</em>&gt;0&quot; should
            be &quot;Assume <em>i(0)=</em>0.&quot;</p>
            <p>p. 229, Answer to Practice Problem 6.9: &quot;320 J&quot; should
            be &quot;324 J.&quot; (The given answer of 320 J would be correct
            if we had been asked to find the change in energy between <em>t</em>=0&nbsp;s
            and <em>t</em>=4&nbsp;s.) </p>
            <p>p. 233, Answer to part (c) of Practice Problem 6.12: The answers
            are correct, but are given in the wrong order. The question asks
              for <em>v</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>t</em>), <em>v</em><sub>2</sub>(<em>t</em>),
              and <em>v</em>(<em>t</em>), but the answers are given in the following
              order: <em>v</em>(<em>t</em>), <em>v</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>t</em>),
              and <em>v</em><sub>2</sub>(<em>t</em>).</p>
            <p>p. 319, first line: &quot;5<em>i<sub>R</sub></em>&quot; should
            be &quot;2<em>i<sub>R</sub></em>.&quot; This change results in three
            changes to the following line: both instances of &quot;1/5&quot; should be
            &quot;1/2,&quot; and &quot;2/15&quot; should be &quot;1/3.&quot; </p>
            <p>p. 323, fifth line after Equation (8.26): &quot;Figure 8.9 assumes&quot; should
            be &quot;Parts (a) and (b) of Figure 8.9 assume.&quot;</p>
            <p>p. 330, Answer to Practice Problem 8.5: &quot;&minus;2<em>te</em><sup>&minus;10<em>t</em></sup><em>u</em>(<em>t</em>)              V&quot; should
              be &quot;&minus;2<em>te</em><sup>&minus;10<em>t</em></sup>
              V.&quot; For consistency with
            the other problems in this section, and since the problem specifies
            that <em>t</em>&gt;0, there's no need for <em>u</em>(<em>t</em>) in the answer. </p>
            <p>p. 336, Figure 8.20: On the graph's vertical axis, the scale marker between
            20 and 30 should be 25 instead of 35.</p>
            <p>p. 342, Equation (8.10.3): The unit should be A/s instead of V/s.</p>
            <p>p. 347, sixth line from the bottom: &quot;<em>v</em>(1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;6.75<em>e</em><sup>&minus;1</sup><em></em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.75<em>e</em><sup>&minus;9</sup><em></em> &quot;
               should
            be &quot;<em>v</em>(1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;6.75<em>e</em><sup>&minus;1</sup><em></em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.75<em>e</em><sup>&minus;9</sup><em></em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;6.&quot; Also,
            on the following line, &quot;&minus;3.552&quot; should
            be <em></em>&quot;3.552.&quot; (Delete
            the negative sign.) </p>
            <p>p. 357, third line: &quot;1/0&radic;<em>LC</em>&quot; should
            be &quot;1/&radic;<em>LC</em>.&quot;(Delete the 0.) </p>
            <p>p. 375, second line: Insert the unit V at the end of the equation.</p>
            <p>p. 424, Equation (10.6.4): &quot;80&deg;&quot; should be &quot;77.9&deg;.&quot; Also, &quot;10&deg;&quot; should
            be &quot;12.1&deg;.&quot; The first of these changes should also
            be made to the equation before Equation (10.6.4), and the second
            of these changes should also be made to the equation after Equation
            (10.6.4).</p>
            <p>p. 472, Answer to Practice Problem 11.9: &quot;177.5&ang;33.69&deg;&nbsp;VA&quot; should
            be &quot;177.5&nbsp;VA,&quot; since apparent power has no angle. </p>
            <p>p. 477, second line: the unit at the end of the equation should
            be kVAR instead of kVA. </p>
            <p></p>
