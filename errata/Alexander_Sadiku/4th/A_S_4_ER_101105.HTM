   Delete the phrase, "or the <i>damping factor</i>,"

       The phrase, <i>neper frequency</i> is preferable for 
       naming the quantity denoted by &alpha; in this textbook.
       In addition to the definition of <i>damping factor</i> 
       implied in this textbook, the phrase <i>damping factor</i>
       has a plurality of other definitions applying in other 
       contexts, for three unique examples see <a href=
       "http://www.rane.com/par-d.html">here</a> and 
       <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/damping-factor"

       >textbook</a> (See page 506 of the textbook). Furthermore, 
       Prof. De Boer has not so far found any place where the 
       phrase <i>damping factor</i> is treated synonymously 
       with <i>neper frequency</i> except in undergraduate 
       circuits and linear systems textbooks or World Wide Web 
       pages presenting similar content.  This limited context 
       is too narrow to justify introducing the phrase 
       <i>damping factor</i> here.  
                                                         <br><br>
       
       A nearly similar term, <a href=
       "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping_ratio"><i>damping 
       ratio</i></a>, (not "factor") is uniformly well defined 
       in many contexts, including RLC circuits, but the neper 
       frequency (&alpha; in our textbook) and the damping 
       <i>ratio</i> are not the same thing.  Using our textbook's 
       notation, the damping ratio, &zeta;, would be defined as 
       &zeta;&nbsp;=&nbsp; &alpha;/&omega;<sub>o</sub>.  Since 
       most engineering students will encounter the term 
       <i>damping ratio</i> in their careers, the confusingly 
       similar name, <i>damping factor</i> (also known as 
       <i>damping attenuation factor</i>, <i>attenuatin 
       factor</i>, and <i>damping coefficient</i>, etc.) should 
       not be introduced in the context of RLC circuits.  The 
       name <i>neper frequency</i> for &alpha; is more memorable, 
       more universal in the literature, and thus more helpful.

     The basis for duality is found in the duality of electric 
     and magnetic fields implied by the Lorentz transformation. 
     The Lorentz transformation has its roots in the theory of
     special relativity.  Thus the theory of duality found in 
     electric circuits is not restricted to planar circuits, only
     the method shown in this textbook is so restricted.  
     However the utility of the method shown in this textbook 
     merits its mention.                    </small></blockquote>
