<b>PSice is loaded on most engineering lab computers.</b><br>
Professor De Boer thinks it is most convenient to do your PSpice 
work on one of Dordt's computers so that you do not have to 
install PSpice.  However a <i>trial version</i> is available for 
free.  You may download it and install it on your personal
computer at your option.</p><p>

<b>The trial version has all the features and capabilities of the 
regular version and no expiration date.</b>  However it does limit 
the number of circuit elements that may be included in a 
simulation.  This restriction has never been an issue with work
done by students here at Dordt.  Thus, for the purposes of this 
course, you would never be able to tell the difference between 
the trial version and the regular version.               </P><p>

<b>To get started downloading, click on the PSpice logo</b> (the image 
above).  There you can read more about the program.  Note that 
PSpice is downloaded as part of a larger software package called 
OrCAD.  After clicking on the logo above a new window opens and 
you have several choices.  <br><br>

<b>Third option.</b>  (Recommended) If you only want to use the 
software to do homework for this class, you need only download 
the "OrCAD PSpice Designer Lite (Capture & PSpice Only)" 
version.  Scroll down to find it since this is the 
third choice offered on the page.  After installation 
it will occupy about 2&nbsp;GB of your hard drive.</p><p>
                                               
<b>PSpice was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29"
>forked</a> from an earlier program called SPICE.</b>  You can
read more about SPICE <a href="http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/classes/IcBook/SPICE/"
>here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE"
>here</a>.  Practically all commands and features of spice are 
supported in the lite version of PSpice that we use here at 
Dordt College.  <b>Thus documentation for SPICE can be used with 
and applied to PSpice.</b></p><p>
