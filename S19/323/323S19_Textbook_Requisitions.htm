<b><u>Comments</u>:</b><br><br>

<b>EACH STUDENT NEEDS A TEXTBOOK</b><br>
Some tests and the final exam in this course will be "open book." Each student will simultaneously need access to a textbook. Textbooks may not be shared during a test or during the final exam. Each student should personally bring a textbook to each class.<br><br>

<b>SAME TEXTBOOK WAS USED IN EGR 322 IN THE FALL OF 2018</b><br>
This is the same textbook that was used in the fall of 2018 for EGR 322.  If you took that class you should continue using the textbook you already own. <br><br>

<b>NO ADDITIONAL TEXTBOOK IS REQUIRED FOR THE LAB</b><br>
Professor De Boer will provide his own lab handouts.<br><br>  

<b>ELECTRONIC EDITIONS NOT SUPPORTED</b><br>
Electronic editions of the textbook will not be allowed for use on open book tests or on the final exam. If you order the electronic edition you will have to print pages to bring to the tests with you.<br><br>

<b>INTERNATIONAL EDITIONS NOT SUPPORTED</b><br>
International editions of the textbook will not be supported by the instructor.  Often the vender assures that an international edition is interchangeable with the domestic edition.  It has <i>never</i> worked that way in Professor DDB's experience.<br><br>

<b>CDs, ACCESS CODES NOT NEEDED</b><br>
The textbook required for this course does not require access codes to Web pages.  The book does not come with a CD or other disk.<br><br>

<b>PAPERBACK EDITIONS NOT SUPPORTED</b><br>
In Professor DDB's experience the paperback editions of this textbook are always an international edition.  See above on "INTERNATIONAL EDITIONS NOT SUPPORTED."<br><br>

<b>NCEES-approved CALCULATOR REQUIRED</b><br>
Only NCEES-approved calculators are allowed at tests and the final exam and a calculator is required.  Routinely using a calculator that you can take with you to the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam will improve your performance on the exam.  In this course a calculator that can handle complex arithmetic is helpful.  The approved list can be found here: <a href="http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/">http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/</a> Not all calculators on this list can do complex arithmetic, but the <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/scientific-calculators/ti-36x-pro">TI-36X-Pro</a> model can and is the choice of most engineering students at Dordt College. Calculators may not be shared during tests.  You must provide one for yourself.<br><br>

<b>HELPFUL TEXTBOOK WEB SITE</b><br>
FYI this textbook has an accompanying web site that is more useful for students than your average textbook web site.  Click above on the cover photo to view the publisher's web site for the book.<br><br>
