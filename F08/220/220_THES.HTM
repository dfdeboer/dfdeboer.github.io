<H2>Example One</H2>

<P>Nicola Tesla invented polyphase electric circuits.</P>

<P><font color="red">This thesis has no element of controversy, 
therefore it is not a good thesis.  Assuming a good bibliography, 
the grade is "C."  Without a bibliography the grade is 
"F."</font></P><BR> 



<H2>Example Two</H2>

<P>Nicola Tesla invented the polyphase electric system.  This system 
needed to compete with Edison's DC electric system.  The public 
was not initially supportive but the technical superiority of the 
polyphase systems eventually completely dominated the market.  
</P>

<P><font color="red">This thesis is workable.  (Grade is "A.")  
The author needs to show that the public was initially skeptical 
of polyphase systems and that it was primarily the technical 
superiority of the polyphase systems that accounted for success.  
The thesis is also narrow in that Tesla is a very complicated 
personality, and most of this is not dealt with.  This narrowness 
is a a strength of the thesis.  It helps the author of the paper 
focus on one manageable aspect of Tesla's life.  A weakness of 
the thesis is that it deals only weakly with the contribution of 
polyphase systems to culture--and primarily only in the aspect of 
a process by which the public accepted one technology.  The 
thesis could be made stronger by changing the last sentence to, 
</font> "The public eventually supported polyphase systems 
because they allowed electrical power generators, and their 
associated buildings and pollution, to be moved outside of 
cities." <font color="red">  This paper will show how Tesla 
<i>influenced culture</i></font>.</P><BR> 


<H2>Example Three</H2>

<P>Nicola Tesla believed that war could be averted if the 
underlying causes of war, which he took to be misunderstanding 
between cultures and confused communications, could be solved.  
This motivated him to develop electrical technologies to reduce 
the effects of distance.  Transportation and communication 
technologies thus occupied an increasing share of his attention 
throughout his life.</P> 

<P><font color="red">This is good thesis.  (Grade is "A.")  There 
is a need to keep the scope of the paper limited to just 
supporting this thesis, otherwise the paper could become too 
diffuse and meandering.  The paper needs to establish Tesla's 
beliefs in the causes of war and to show some evidence that his 
beliefs motivated his work on transportation and communication 
technologies.  This paper will show what <i>motivated</i> 
Tesla</font></P><BR> 

<H2>Note:</H2>
<P>Nicola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, before January 1, 
1880.  He is not a "20th century inventor."  Thus, you 
should not choose Tesla as a subject for your paper.  The 
examples however still illustrate levels of quality in thesis 
statements.
