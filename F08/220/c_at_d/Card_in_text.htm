            <b>What is this "First Aid" envelope in the cover of my text?</b><br><br>
            
            First of all, it is not important.  Inside the 
            envelope of a new textbook there is a card with a 
            registration number to give you password protected 
            access to web applets coordinated with the textbook. 
            The registration number may only be used once to set 
            up your account. Used textbooks might not have the 
            card. </font><b><br>Read more . . .</b><br><br>
            
            If you have a used textbook the registration number 
            might already have been used, in which case the 
            previous owner was supposed to write the login and 
            password on the card for your use.  If that information 
            is present, maybe the account will still work.
            
            If you have no login and password, or an invalid login
            and password combination, and the registration
            code has been used, then when you try to register you will 
            get an "Invalid regcode" error.  Since this text is 
            now out of print, probably most codes have been 
            used once and are now invalid. If you want to try 
            your card, the URL for signing up for an account 
            has changed from that printed on the card to:<br><br> 
            
            <a href="http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&itemId=0471447951&bcsId=1559"
            >http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&itemId=0471447951&bcsId=1559</a><br><br>
            After clicking on the above link, click on 
            "Login/Register" and follow instructions on screen 
            and/or on your card from there.<br><br> But do not 
            worry if your registration number does not work. 
            <b>Do not pay to get a new registration code</b>  The 
            publisher now offers the <a href="applet_directory.htm"
            >applets for free</a>.
