<b>Further discussion of problems 5-1 and 5-2</b></p><p>
 
The tables given for problems 5-2 and 5-1 contain a few 
challenges.  On the first line of each table it is not possible 
to know  what <i>Q</i> will be. Just label that output <i>U</i> 
where <i>U</i> stands for an unknown logic level that could be 
either a logic-0 or a logic-1.  Then what will 
<img src="Q_UC_BAR.gif" alt="Q_bar"> be? (It is not what 
<i>Q</i> is.  In other words, it is <img src="U_UC_BAR.gif" 
alt="U_bar">.) In some following lines the same problem occurs. Handle them the same 
way. If you used Quartus II to run this simulation note that it 
gives an undefined output in these cases.</p><p>

In the last line of the table for 5-2 two input bits change at 
the same time, which is not allowed for a simulation of this 
type.  Flag this by noting that the outputs will be        
unknown. If you used the Quartus II simulator to do this problem, 
what does Quartus&nbsp;II do in this situation? (An automatic 
simulation cannot catch this problem. With no warning it gives a 
result but the result is unreliable.)
