             INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOWNLOADING <br>

            FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH EGR 204   <br></td></tr>

<b>Downloading is NOT Required</b><br>
Quartus II is installed on most engineering lab computers.  It is  
quite practical to do all your Quartus II work on one of 
Dordt's computers.  It is not necessary for you to download it 
and install it on your personal computer, but Altera offers  
you permission to do so.                                </p><p>

<b>Quartus II is a big program</b><br>
Altera offers the "Web Edition" of Quartus II for free.  
You need a Windows 7, Vista, or XP computer with about 
4.5&nbsp;GB of free space on your hard drive. (That's quite a 
lot in comparison to most programs.)  The download itself is 
1.95&nbsp;GB.  It is not unusual for this download to take 
more than 15 minutes, sometimes much more, even on a fast 
Internet connection.</p><p>

<b>The Web Edition is Full Featured</b><br>
The Web Edition it has all the features and capabilities of the 
Subscription Edition except that it does not support the newest 
and most powerful FPGA hardware, it cannot do incremental 
compilation, and access to Altera's "intellectual property" 
(pre-compiled designs) is limited.  These restrictions have 
no effect on the work assigned for this course.  For the 
purposes of this course, you would never be able to tell the 
difference between the Web Edition and the Subscription 
Edition.                                                </P><p>

<b>Use The Correct Version</b><br>
Quartus II Web Edition Version 9.1sp2 is recommended for this 
course and will be downloaded if you follow the instructions 
and links here.  The most recent release of Quartus II is 
version 11.1sp1.  The older version is best for work assigned 
in this course for three reasons.  First Version 11.1sp1 
supports more hardware than we need. This consumes hard disk 
space for configuration files that we will never use. 
(About 12 GB vs 4.5 GB for Version 9.1sp2.)  Second, 
variations in menu structures and features make more recent 
versions difficult to use with the tutorials and lab handouts 
that we have.  Third, there are no compelling new features in 
version 11.1sp1 that we could benefit from.                      </p><p>

<b>Click the Logo to Start Downloading</b><br>
To download directly from Altera's FTP server, click on the 
Quartus II logo (the image above).  If you have a campus 
network connection you can try <a href=
"file:///F:/classes/egr/304/Altera/91sp2_quartus_free.exe"
>downloading from Dordt's server</a> This is much faster 
but generally only works on Dordt-owned computers.  Save 
the download to your desktop or some other location where 
you can find it again.  Then run the file.  The 
installation procedure is typical of any Windows program 
from there.                                             </p><p>
