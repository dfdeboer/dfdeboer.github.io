<div class="title">Thank you!  Below is what you submitted to the Bookstore:</div>
<p><strong>EGR-360-01: Intro:Power Systems Analysis</strong></p>
<p>If new editions become available before classes start, would you like to use the new editions?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>If yes, are you aware if a new edition is currently available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will the students enrolling in this course already have the textbook from a previous course that they themselves have taken?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Do you require a CD or access code, if one is available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will you be advising the students that they <strong>NEED</strong> to have their own textbook, that they may share a particular textbook, that they really don't need the textbook, or any other options you might share with the students?  <em>We would appreciate knowing this so that we can make a more responsible order decision on how many textbooks to order.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Tests will be open book.  Sharing a textbook will not be allowed during tests.</strong></p>

<p>Ned Mohan has been a leader in power systems education and research for decades. His power systems book has pioneering coverage relevant to this age of sustainable energy such as wind turbines, photo-voltaics, DC power systems, and the smart grid.  Previously Professor Mohan published a similar book with MNPERE (Minnesota Power electronics Research and Education).  This textbook is an updated edition of his successful MNPERE publication.</p>
