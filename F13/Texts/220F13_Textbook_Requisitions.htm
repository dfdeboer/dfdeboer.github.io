<div class="title">Thank you!  Below is what you submitted to the Bookstore:</div>
<p><strong>EGR-220-01: Linear Circuits</strong></p>
<p>If new editions become available before classes start, would you like to use the new editions?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>If yes, are you aware if a new edition is currently available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p>Will the students enrolling in this course already have the textbook from a previous course that they themselves have taken?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Do you require a CD or access code, if one is available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will you be advising the students that they <strong>NEED</strong> to have their own textbook, that they may share a particular textbook, that they really don't need the textbook, or any other options you might share with the students?  <em>We would appreciate knowing this so that we can make a more responsible order decision on how many textbooks to order.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>The textbook is required for all students in EGR 220. This course will be peer graded. For this reason, every student needs simultaneous access to the textbook. Each student should personally own a textbook.</strong></p>

<p>Only NCEES approved calculators will be allowed for use during tests and
the final exam. The NCEES list of approved calculators can be found
here: <a href="http://ncees.org/exams/calculator-policy/" >http://ncees.org/exams/calculator-policy/</a> The "TI-36X Pro," or the
Casio "fx-115ES PLUS" or the "HP 35S" or any others on the list with
complex number support are especially useful for this course since
complex numbers will be used in the last third of this course. More
about the Engineering Department's calculator policy can be found here:

The latest edition of the required textbook is the fifth edition, now
available. Professor De Boer will not be using the latest edition. It is
mostly page-for-page the same as the less expensive fourth edition. Used
copies of the fourth edition are recommended for cost savings. <br><br>This
textbook is also available directly from the publisher in electronic
format. See
<a href="http://www.coursesmart.com/fundamentals-of-electric-circuits-4th-edition/alexander-charles-sadiku-matthew/dp/0077272366" >http://www.coursesmart.com/fundamentals-of-electric-circuits-4th-edition/alexander-charles-sadiku-matthew/dp/0077272366</a>
but beware that the "free trial" offered there will not get students
through the course. Professor De Boer believes that to date, no students
have used the electronic version in his course. (Used textbooks are much
less expensive than the electronic version, and they don't "expire.")</p>
