|  |       |       |       | B-3-29, B-4-11 tip: "show" means   |
|  |       |       |       | "prove" or in other words, find a  |
|  |       |       |       | math relationship between the two  |
|  |       |       |       | angles.  Use either degrees or     |
|  |       |       |       | radians consistently in your       |
|  |       |       |       | calculations.  Assume both levers  |
|  |       |       |       | (the handle and the elevator       |
|  |       |       |       | support) are initially vertical,   |
|  |       |       |       | and then get moved to the angles   |
|  |       |       |       | shown.  Correction 1) the length of|
|  |       |       |       | the support lever for the elevator |
|  |       |       |       | should be "m," dimensioned between |
|  |       |       |       | the two black dots that represent  |
|  |       |       |       | the hinge pins.  Correction 2) The |
|  |       |       |       | handle (lever with dimension "l"   |
|  |       |       |       | on it) is shown leaning in the     |
|  |       |       |       | wrong direction.  It should lean   |
|  |       |       |       | to the left and angle theta should |
|  |       |       |       | increase in the counterclockwise   |
|  |       |       |       | direction.  A corrected figure     |
|  |       |       |       | 4-58 is available (<A

|  |       |       |       | can be stopped by an impulsive     |
|  |       |       |       | force.  Hints 1) find an input made|
|  |       |       |       | from the sum of an impulse and a   |
|  |       |       |       | delayed impulse.  Show that for the|
|  |       |       |       | right delay and after a certain    |
|  |       |       |       | amount of time the output is zero. |
|  |       |       |       | 2) Is the system linear?  What are |
|  |       |       |       | the consequences of your answer?   |

|  |       |       |       | Mathcad, Matlab, or neatly by hand.|
|  |       |       |       | Put the two formulae on the same   |
|  |       |       |       | plot or on two plots with identical|
|  |       |       |       | axes so that proportions are       |
|  |       |       |       | visually comparable.               |

                             PROJECT          last update 3/28/03
                             -------
Assigned on 3/28.  Due on Friday, 4/25.  
      There are five different projects to choose from.  Samples 
      are posted on the white board in the hallway across from 
      the computer lab, S236.  After you choose a project you may 
      pick up a copy of it from one of the plastic bins in the 
      hallway near the engineering pod.  Also there is a sign-up 
      sheet where you should note the project you have chosen.  
      At most three people may work on the same project.  Each 
      project is to be done individually and each person should 
      turn in a report. 

      The projects are ordinary homework problems which you need 
      to extend.  Principle results (answers) should be computed 
      by more than one method.  Analytic results should be 
      reconciled with computer results.  You should also develop 
      a thesis statement, possibly around a "What if?" question, 
      and defend your thesis.  For example, you might ask "What 
      if the gain is adjusted to eliminate overshoot?"  This 
      could lead to the thesis that, "At least 10% overshoot will 
      need to be tolerated in order to get adequatly small  
      steady-state error responses."  

      Your final report should follow the guidelines in the 
      handout <A HREF = "../S03/221F02LR.DOC">"Writing a Laboratory Report</A>."  If you need a paper
      copy of this handout, ask Prof. De Boer.  The grading 
      rubric is also included in that handout.
