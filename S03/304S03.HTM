    For example, what they call an, "I/O memory location," is 
    generally known as a "memory mapped I/O port."  Other than
    these types of issues, the info in the book is generally 
    applicable to all microcontrollers.

Report #1 on project #1, the interrupt-driven real-time clock due
   4/25.  Write up your assigned part of the over-all project 
   as a formal report.  Include the code you have written and 
   explain how to properly use it.  Also include a copy of the 
   entire project code (as an appendix perhaps).  The due date on 
   this project had been slipping each week.  On 4/15 it was 
   firmly set at 11:40 am, 4/24.  Penalty--one letter grade at 
   each 11:40 am Tu and Th.  (One report per person in the 
   class.)


Report #2 on project #2, the transmission line lab.  Each team 
   must write a report that addresses the issues and questions in 
   the lab handout.  The report should include photographs of the
   reflections (as seen on the oscilloscope) with 
   explanations.  (One report per team of 3.)  Due 5/1 at 11:40 
   am.  Penalty: one letter grade per 24 hours (Sunday excepted).



                              TESTS                 (Last Update:
                              -----             5/01/03 11:15 am)
Test #1, Thursday, 2/20.  Covered power supplies, interrupts and 
     use of the stack, basic concepts in assembly language, RS-
     232, ethernet.  One crib sheet and a calculator were 
     allowed.  A booklet of tables similar to 2 through 16 from 
     the Zilog Z-80 User's Manual was provided with the test. 
     (The tables were corrected versions of what is in the Zilog 
     manual.)  Handed back on 2/25. 

Test #2, Thursday 4/17,  Covered Transmission lines, grounding, 
     and shielding.  One crib sheet and a calculator were 
     allowed.  (On april 3 the original test date of 4/10 was 
     changed to 4/17.)  Handed back on 4/29.

Final exam, Monday 5/5, 1:15 - 3:15, will cover the entire 
     course.  Specifically, the topics listed for tests one and 
     two plus hardware I/O techniques (LED,s, LCDs and 
     multiplexing of LCD displays, protection from inductive 
     loads), stepper motors, position sensing.  Two crib sheets 
     and a calculator will be allowed.  The Zilog data sheets 
     from the first test will again be provided with the exam.
