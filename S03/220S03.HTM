                              TESTS        (Last update: 5/01/03)
                              -----
Quiz, Monday, 1/27, Covered Ch. 1, Ch. 2 except section 2.8, and 
   Ch. 3 through section 3.6.  No crib sheets or calculators were 
   allowed.  (On Friday, 1/24 the quiz was rescheduled from 1/24 
   to 1/27.)  Handed back on Wednesday, 1/29.

Test #1, Wednesday, 2/26. The test covered Chapters 1 through 4 
   and through section 5-4 of Chapter 5, omitting sections 4-9 
   and 4-10.  Preparation to solve systems of linear algebraic 
   equations with at most three unknowns was expected.  No crib 
   sheets allowed.  A calculator was allowed (and recommended).  
   (On 2/24 via class discussion we decided to allow 
   calculators.)  Handed back on 2/28.  Raw score info: High=100, 
   Avg.=76, Low=44.  

Test #2, Wednesday, 4/2, Covered through section 7-8 of 
   Chapter 7.  Emphasis was on the material covered since test 
   #1.  Sections in the text on PSpice and Matlab were omitted 
   from the test, specifically sections 5-8, 5-9, 6-8, and 6-9. 
   No crib sheets were allowed.  A calculator was allowed. 
   Handed back on 4/4. Raw score info: High=100, Avg.=75, Low=30. 

Final Exam, Tuesday 5/6 from 8:00 am to 10:00 am.  Will cover
   the entire course with emphasis on each topic roughly 
   proportional to the time spent on the topic.  Specifically 
   covered will be all of Chapters 1 through 8 except these 
   Sections: 4-9, 4-10, 5-8, 5-9, 6-8, 6-9, 7-10, 7-11, 8-8, 8-9.
   Also included will be problems from Chapter 9 that can be 
   solved by the "classical" technique, that is applying KVL or 
   KCL to get a differential equation and then solving that 
   equation for the total solution (sum of natural and particular 
   or transient and forced solutions).  Also in included will be 
   Sections 10-1 through 10-3 in Chapter 10.  No crib sheets will 
   be allowed.  A calculator will be allowed and is recommended.  
   Knowing how to use complex numbers with your calculator is 
   also recommended.
