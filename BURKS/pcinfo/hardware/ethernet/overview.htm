<blockquote>This tutorial has been prepared as a deliverable for my
HND Information Systems final project and as an online learning resource
for ethernet technology. The content is aimed primarily at university students
of information systems, but I hope that people of all abilities will find
it of some use.

<p>The online tutorial concept touches on the notion of evolutionary
learning. Amongst other things, the internet is a constantly changing learning
environment, lending itself to the structured dissemination of information.
It is sometimes unfair to preach technical opinions to students, therefore
the resources should be made available for individuals to form their own
views.

<p>Some information technology courses do not have sufficient breadth
or curriculum time to pursue each facet of ethernet. Therefore, a properly
managed web site can offer instruction and links, to remote sites, that
give a different perspective or greater depth.</blockquote>
This site is structured to provide:
<ul>
<li>
Clear and concise information in a consistently structured interface.</li>

<li>
Simple navigation to local and remote resources.</li>

<li>
Balanced opinion in light of divergent theories in local area network
technology.</li>

<li>
A local site search facility to speed access to information.</li>
</ul>
