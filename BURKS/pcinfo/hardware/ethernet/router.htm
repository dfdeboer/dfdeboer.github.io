<p><h2>What do they do?</h2>

<p>A router is a device that <b>interconnects networks</b>
and decides the<b> best path</b> over which to send
data between networks. Routers use the <b>logical (e.g.
IP) address information</b> contained within ethernet <a HREF="framepac.htm">frames</a>.

<p>It is also possible to define a router as a device that &quot;switches&quot;
at the <b>internet layer </b><b>(layer
3)</b> of the <a HREF="tcpip.htm">TCP/IP protocol suite</a>. Routers
should not be confused with ethernet <a HREF="switch.htm">switches</a>
that operate using the medium access control (MAC) address, inherent in
the <a HREF="nic.htm">network interface card</a>, at the <b>datalink
sublayer</b> (layer 2) of the network access layer.

<p>The internet layer protocol declares the <b>logical
source and destination addresses</b> and any routing parameters in the
frame. A good example of such a parameter is the number of routers a frame
is allowed to cross prior to reaching its destination. Therefore, a packet
can almost be assigned a level of priority. Switches and routers can interoperate,
but <b>multilayer switches</b> are available that
provide datalink switching and internet routing in one device.

<p>The use of routers and multilayer switches has evolved to produce
two different architectures:

<p><img SRC="images/distinct.gif" ALT="DistinctRouter.gif" HSPACE="5" NOSAVE BORDER="2" HEIGHT="212" WIDTH="535">
<p>Distinct
layer 2 switching and layer 3 routing utilises separate routers and switches.
As stated above, ethernet switches operate at layer 2 and ethernet routers
operate at layer 3. The LAN switches handle the interconnection needs of
the small, geographically close, LANs. A single router is used to handle
traffic between the larger remote LAN and the smaller LANs. This is a fairly
common architecture. Some networking professionals think that networks
should switch if they can and route if they must.

<p><img SRC="images/distribu.gif" ALT="DistributedRouter.gif" HSPACE="5" NOSAVE BORDER="2" HEIGHT="212" WIDTH="368">
<p>Distributed
routing does away with separate switches and routers. Instead, multilayer
switching is employed to handle network traffic between the small LANs
and the remote LAN. The use of a single, relatively expensive, device does
not create a significant cost reduction initially, but the reduced management
needs should not be underestimated.

<p><h2>How do they do it?</h2>

<p>A router will <b>examine a frame</b> and <b>determine
the logical address of the destination device</b> from the internet
layer protocol header. Routers hold a <b>routing table</b>,
listing available networks, that allows them to <b>effectively
switch network traffic</b> over the most effective route. These tables
also include a measure of the quality of the connection to a network and
the address of the next device required to forward data to that network.
Routers share the information held in these routing tables and they are
able to <b>incorporate new routes</b> to networks,
as they are added, and <b>delete routes</b> that
have become unstable or unusable. <b>A </b><b>router
modifies frames</b> by altering the source MAC (layer 2) address to
its own. The <b>source and destination logical addresses
remain the same</b>.

<p>There is a great deal of discussion over the future of routing and
there are three possibilities:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Distinct layer 2 switching and layer 3 routing</b>.
Layer 2 switching gives good LAN bandwidth but it requires the sophistication
of layer 3 routing to provide advanced filtering and security. Each device
does what is it best at.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
<b>Distributed routing</b>. Layer 2 switching
and layer 3 routing functionality is combined in a single device - the
<b>multilayer switch</b>.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
<b>Routing servers</b>. A central computer holds
the bulk of routing information. Special devices known as <b>edge
switches</b> are deployed in LANs with a minimum of routing information.</li>
</ul>
