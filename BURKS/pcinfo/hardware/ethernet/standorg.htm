<p><h2>What are they?</h2>

<p>There are essentially three bodies that formulate communication protocols
and standards:
<ul>
<li>
<b>International Standards Organisation</b>.
The ISO produced the <a HREF="osi.htm">OSI seven layer reference model</a>,
but also sets standards for character sets, programming languages and database
connectivity. The ISO collaborates with the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) to ratify its standards. The ISO dates from 1947 and has
a membership of around 100 smaller standardisation bodies from participating
countries. The OSI model came from the work of committee TC97 - Information
Processing Systems.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
<b>International Telecommunications Union</b>.
The ITU was formerly the <b>CCITT</b>
(Comite Consulatif Telegraphique et Telephonique). The ITU works mainly
to develop new standards to allow equipment to connect with public telecommunications.
Emergent technologies such as ISDN owe much to the work of the ITU, although
the ITU is also involved in fax. The body publishes volumes of recommendations
every four years.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
<b>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</b>.
The IEEE is an American organisation that manages multiple research projects.
It has international authority having been heavily involved in the standardisation
of <a HREF="ethernet.htm">ethernet</a> and <a HREF="token.htm">token ring</a>
LANs. The IEEE established committee number 802 in February 1980. 802 has
been responsible for the IEEE 802.3 ethernet and IEEE 802.5 token ring
standards. Ethernet standards are discussed further <a HREF="standard.htm">here</a>!</h2></li>
</ul>
The ultimate goal of the various bodies is to
create a set of standards that will increasingly allow a vendor to develop
equipment that can communicate with devices manufactured by other vendors.
