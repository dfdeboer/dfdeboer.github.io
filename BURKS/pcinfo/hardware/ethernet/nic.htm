<p><h2>What do they do?</h2>

<p><img SRC="images/nic.jpg" ALT="NIC.jpg" NOSAVE BORDER="2" HEIGHT="259" WIDTH="374">
<p>Network
interface cards (NICs) are installed in a computer to allow it to communicate
with a network. They provide a transparent interface between the network
and the computer. The computer gives the NIC a message for another networked
device and the NIC formats that message for transport over the <a HREF="media.htm">media</a>.
The reverse is also true, the NIC receives messages from the network and
reformats them so that the computer can understand. NICs have their own
<b>CPU</b> (central processing unit) and <b>RAM</b>
(random access memory).

<p>NICs come in many shapes and sizes. They can be installed internally
or externally, although an internal installation is more likely. The picture
illustrates an internally installed <b>combo </b><b>(more
than one type of connection)</b> card. This card is somewhat unusual
in that it supports three connections:
<ul>
<li>
The upper connection is an <b>RJ45</b> female
for <b>UTP</b> media.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
The middle connection is a <b>BNC</b> connector
for thin <b>coaxial</b> media.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
The lower connection is a <b>DB-15</b> connector
for a thick ethernet <b>viper tap</b>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do they do it?</h2>

<p>The NIC has to be able to comply with the method of <a HREF="mac.htm">medium
access control</a> (eg. CSMA/CD) for the network. The MAC methodology is
represented at the <b>datalink sublayer</b><b>
of the</b><b> network access layer</b> of the
<a HREF="tcpip.htm">TCP/IP protocol suite</a>. Each NIC has it's own MAC
address that is assigned to it by the manufacturer. It is up to the network
administrator to assign an <a HREF="tcpippot.htm">IP</a> address to
the device in which the NIC is installed.

<p>In order for a NIC to operate effectively, it must be able to carry
out its interface tasks with minimum disruption to the CPU of the computer
in which it is installed. Four methods of NIC to computer data transfer
are used:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Bus mastering DMA (direct memory access)</b>:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Data enters the NIC from the network.</li>

<li>
The NIC's own CPU stores data in the NIC's RAM.</li>

<li>
NIC's CPU sends data to computer's motherboard when the network transmission
is complete.</li>

<li>
The computer's CPU is not interrupted - the NIC's CPU has ultimate responsibility
for data transfer.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>DMA</b>:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Data enters the NIC from the network.</li>

<li>
The NIC's CPU interrupts the computer's CPU.</li>

<li>
The computer's CPU stops other tasks and transfers the network data
into its RAM.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Programmed I/O (input/output)</b>:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Data enters the NIC from the network.</li>

<li>
The NIC's CPU loads the network data into a motherboard I/O address.</li>

<li>
The computer's CPU checks the I/O address for any network data.</li>

<li>
If there is any data, the computer's CPU transfers the data to its RAM.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Shared memory</b>:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Data enters the NIC from the network.</li>

<li>
The NIC's CPU stores the data in the NIC's RAM.</li>

<li>
The NIC's CPU interrupts the computer's CPU.</li>

<li>
The computer's CPU stops other tasks and transfers the network data
into its RAM.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>What else can they do?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Some manufacturers have developed motherboards with <b>onboard
NICs</b> (not a seperate card, but a device intrinsic in the motherboard).<br>
<br></li>

<li>
<b>Dual cards</b> - some cards can support <b>two
speeds of data transfer</b>, eg. 10/100 cards that can detect whether
data is arriving at 10Mbps or 100Mbps.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
<b>Multiport cards</b> - suited for servers where
spare expansion slots are at a premium. The NIC can have upto four ports
on a single card.</li>
</ul>
