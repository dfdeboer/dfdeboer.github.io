<p><h2>What is physical topology?</h2>

<p>&quot;Topology&quot; can be used to describe the <b>shape</b>
of a network. It is a term that should be used with care as its misuse
can be misleading. The following discussion will describe <b>physical
topology</b> simply to aid in the understanding of how different types
of ethernet are implemented. Beyond the bus and star topologies mentioned
below, the ring topology is discussed elsewhere, in terms of <a HREF="token.htm">token
ring</a>.

<p>Confusion can arise if a <b>10BaseT</b>, or
<b>100BaseT</b>, network is described as having a
star topology. These networks have a star <b>physical</b>
topology, but they are <b>bussed</b> across the hub.
Some texts prefer to avoid difficulties altogether by not discussing topologies
at all.

<p><h2>So what does a bus physical topology look like?</h2>

<p>All network elements are connected to the same medium via a short cable. Data
propagates along the medium in both directions from the transmitting device.
<b>Terminators are required</b>, at the end of the
bus, to prevent reflection of the signals across the media.

<p><b>Buses are vulnerable to cable damage</b>.
If any part of the bus is damaged, the whole network grinds to a halt.
Some network devices will be isolated from the rest of the network and
any signal propagating across the bus will be distorted by the damage to
the cable. Proper network documentation is always essential to aid in fault
finding, but this is particularly the case in bussed installations. If
an unknown device is transmitting masses of corrupt data, it may be difficult
to identify which device is responsible and then isolate it.

<p>Many bussed installations are legacies and are being superseded by
10BaseT and 100BaseT, but there are advantages to the bus - a relatively
short length of media is required to connect all devices and they are a
simple solution to the needs of distributed computing. CSMA/CD is used
as the method of <a HREF="mac.htm">medium access control</a>.

<p><b>10Base5 </b>installations
use a viper tap to pierce the thick coaxial cable <a HREF="media.htm">media</a>
that acts as the bus. The viper tap has a short length of thick coaxial
that is used to connect the tap to the <a HREF="nic.htm">network interface
card</a>.

<p><b>10Base2 </b>installations
use a BNC T-piece. The thin coaxial bus is cut and a T-piece used to join
the two ends. The third connection on the T-piece is attached to a short
cable, which, in turn, connects to the network interface card.

<p><h2>So what does a star physical topology look like?</h2>

<p><img SRC="images/startopo.gif" ALT="StarTopology.gif" NOSAVE BORDER="2" HEIGHT="238" WIDTH="297">
<p>All devices on the segment are connected to a hub, this is analogous to a star
shape with the hub at the centre and other devices radiating out from it.
Each device has its own connection to the hub. The hub is, therefore, vital
to the operation of the network. It is good practice to have upto
twice as many hub ports as required. Should a port fail, the cable can
simply be swapped to one of the spare ports. This is known as <b>redundancy</b>.

<p>Both 10BaseT and 100BaseT use a star physical
topology over unshielded twisted pair wire
media.

<p>Each device has its own link to the network, but star physical topologies
can still suffer from congestion. This is due to the broadcast nature of
ethernet - each station still uses CSMA/CD. Every broadcast from any device
propagates to all other devices in order to reach its intended destination.
This leads to unnecessary traffic that could overwhelm an already struggling
network. <a HREF="switch.htm">Switches</a> can be used in the place of
hubs to manage traffic more effectively.
