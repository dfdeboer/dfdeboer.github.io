<p><h2>What is the future of ethernet?</h2>

<p><b>Ethernet is a proven technology</b> that
has progressively evolved from low bandwidth coaxial, to 10BaseT, <a HREF="switch.htm">switching</a>,
100BaseT and now to the emergent gigabit technology. IT innovation moves
so rapidly that only sound methods and architectures will stand the test
of time. Greater reliance on networks, increased multi-media development
and the need for high bandwidth across backbones to the desktop has spurred
ethernet's change.

<p>The explosion in the use of intranets has heightened the need for
networks that can carry out their usual resource sharing tasks and convey
information graphically. An intranet is basically a LAN operating with
<a HREF="tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a>. The Faculty of Information Technology network
at the University of Brighton is an intranet. Large commercial organisations
see intranets as an ideal way of operating a client/server environment,
accessing the internet and communicating effectively with employees.

<p><a HREF="atm.htm">ATM</a> has long been considered a reliable wide
area technology, but the need to provide quality video conferencing and
guaranteed <b>quality of service </b><b>(QoS)</b>,
has seen some organisations install ATM to the desktop. Whilst this is
still quite rare, ATM is a strong contender for networking high bandwidth
applications.

<p>In addition to gigabit, <b>isochronous ethernet</b>
is being developed. The <a HREF="standorg.htm">IEEE</a> have ratified
a standard (802.9a), for the so-called isoethernet, that will enable existing
ethernet infrastructures to support multimedia. Isoethernet is a <b>marriage
of ethernet with ISDN technology</b> that should provide the sought
after quality of service that conventional ethernet lacks. A network is
said to be isochronous when it can operate in real time and support such
things as conversations across continents with no time delay. It is different
to ATM in that it runs at a maximum of 100Mbps and the use of ISDN means
that buffers are not required to smooth out fast bursts folowed by slower
transmission. Isoethernet is <b>simple to integrate</b>
in an existing 10BaseT network by installing an <b>isochronous
hub</b> and<b> isochronous network interface cards</b>.

<p><b>Gigabit ethernet</b> is seen primarily as
a technology with which to create high speed backbones. It offers 1Gbps
and is not seen as daunting to install as ATM for network managers familiar
with existing ethernet. Whilst gigabit does not offer QoS, sectors of the
industry are keen for gigabit to adopt some sort of standard. 1000BaseT
is gigabit ethernet over existing Cat5 UTP <a HREF="media.htm">media</a>,
specified by <b>IEEE 802.3ab</b>. The IEEE envisage
that the standard will be fully ratified by 1999.&nbsp; Manufacturers such
as <a HREF="http://www.3com.com">3Com</a> and <a HREF="http://www.cisco.com">Cisco</a>
are keen to provide the industry with equipment prior to the full ratification
of the standard.
