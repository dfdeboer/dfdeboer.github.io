<p><h2>What are managed devices?</h2>

<p>Managed devices are pieces of hardware, such as <a HREF="hub.htm">hubs</a>
and <a HREF="router.htm">routers</a>, that support software <b>management
agents</b>. Agents monitor and report the status of the devices, on
which they run, to a monitoring device such as a server. Not all networking
devices support management, it is an extra expense. Network management
has become increasingly important. As an infrastructures ages and users
place increasingly high demands on its capabilities, network managers need
a good overview of how the network is responding. Hubs and routers are
ideal places to gather information as all traffic must pass through both
devices.

<p>The success of <a HREF="tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> has meant that the
simple network management protocol (<b>SNMP</b>),
and the <b>SNMP2</b> derivative, have become the
standard <a HREF="tcpippot.htm">protocols</a> for gathering network
data. Centralised management systems, running on servers, can gather information
from managed devices and store it in a database known as a <b>management
information base</b>. The database can be easily interrogated to provide
statistics on the performance of the network.

<p>Original SMNP agents had to be polled for information, leading to
increased traffic simply to obtain traffic flow information. They were
unable to automatically communicate with management systems, therefore
conditions of concern were not reported as they arose. SMNP2 was
developed to allow management of devices across networks that did not run
TCP/IP, automatically report alarms and provide security for its transmissions.

<p>SNMP2 supports<b> Novell's IPX/SPX</b> and
<b>Macintosh's AppleTalk</b> protocols and offers
management system authentification, encryption of management information
and the ability to allow more than one agent per device. Due to the more
secure nature of SNMP2, devices can be monitored and configured remotely.
Unfortunately, <a HREF="standorg.htm">standardisation organisations</a>
have been unable to agree on much of what SNMP2 offers, so it has never
fully been implemented.
