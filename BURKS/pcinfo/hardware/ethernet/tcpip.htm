<p><h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>TCP/IP is a suite of protocols, also known as the Internet Protocol
Suite. It should not be confused with the <a HREF="osi.htm">OSI reference
model</a>, although elements of TCP/IP exist in OSI. The transmission control
protocol and the internet protocol are fundamental to the suite, hence
the TCP/IP title. The suite was originally developed for the US Department
of Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) network, but it is
now the basis for the Internet and many intranets - such as the <a HREF="http://www.ituser.it.brighton.ac.uk">Faculty
of Information Technology</a> intranet at the <a HREF="http://www.brighton.ac.uk">University
of Brighton</a>.

<p>Research started in the 1970s and the incorporation of TCP/IP into
the University of California distribution of Unix hastened exposure to
academics and industrialists. The University of California Unix is also
known as the Berkeley distribution. The suite formed the basis for the
interoperability that is fundamental to distributed computing. It was originally
assumed that organisations would use TCP/IP prior to migrating to the newer
OSI protocols, although this transition has never really happened.

<h2>What's
in the layers and what do they do?</h2>

<p>As with the OSI model, the TCP/IP suite uses a layered model. The
OSI model has seven layers, the TCP/IP model has four or five - depending
on who you talk to and which books you read!. Some people call it a four
layer suite - <b>Application</b>,<b>
Transport</b>,<b> Internet
</b>and<b> Network Access</b>,
others split the <b>Network Access </b>layer
into its <b>Physical </b>and
<b>Datalink </b>components.
This diagram of the suite represents something of a compromise! Some of
the protocols that comprise the TCP/IP model are explained further on the
<a HREF="tcpippot.htm">TCP/IP Protocols</a> page.

<h2>Layer 5 - Application</h2>

<p>This layer is broadly equivalent to the application,
presentation and session layers of the OSI model. It gives an application
access to the communication environment. Examples of protocols found
at this layer are <b>Telnet</b>,
<b>FTP (File Tranfer Protocol)</b>,
<b>SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)</b>,
<b>HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) </b>and
<b>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</b>.</h2>

<h2>Layer 4 - Transport</h2>

<p>The transport layer is similar to the OSI transport
model, but with elements of the OSI session layer functionality. This layer
provides an application layer delivery service. The two protocols found
at the transport layer are <b>TCP (Transmission
Control Protocol) </b>and <b>UDP
(User Datagram Protocol)</b>. Either of these
two protocols are used by the application layer process, the choice depends
on the application's transmission reliability requirements.

<p><b>TCP</b> is a <b>reliable,
connection-oriented</b> protocol that provides
error checking and&nbsp; flow control through a virtual link that it establishes
and finally terminates. This gives a reliable service, therefore TCP would
be utilised by FTP and SNMP - file transfer and email delivery have to
be accurate and error free.

<p><b>UDP</b> is an <b>unreliable,
connectionless</b> protocol that provides data
transport with lower network traffic overheads than TCP - UDP does not
error check or offer any flow control, this is left to the application
process. SNMP uses UDP - SNMP is used to monitor network performance,&nbsp;
so its operation must not contribute to congestion.

<h2>Layer 3 - Internet</h2>

<p>This layer is responsible for the routing and
delivery of data across networks. It allows communication across networks
of the same and different types and carries out translations to deal with
dissimilar data addressing schemes. <b>IP (Internet
Protocol) </b>and <b>ARP
(Address Resolution Protocol) </b>are both to
be found at the Internet layer.

<h2>Layers 2 and 1 - Network Access</h2>

<p>The combination of datalink and physical layers
deals with pure hardware (wires, satellite links, <a HREF="nic.htm">network
interface cards</a>, etc.) and access methods such as <b>CSMA/CD</b>
(carrier sensed multiple access with collision detection). <a HREF="ethernet.htm">Ethernet</a>
exists at the network access layer - its hardware operates at the physical
layer and its <a HREF="mac.htm">medium access control</a> method (CSMA/CD)
operates at the datalink layer.
