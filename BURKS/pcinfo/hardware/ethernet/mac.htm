<p><h2>What is medium access control?</h2>

<p>In terms of <b>non-switched ethernet</b>, medium
access control (<b>MAC</b>) is an effective methodology
that allows devices on a LAN to share their interconnecting <a HREF="media.htm">media</a>.
A discussion on switching, and why it does not use the method outlined
below, can be found <a HREF="switch.htm">here</a>.

<p>Due to the shared nature of the media, it is obvious that more than
one device might send data at the same time, therefore ethernet MAC has
to be able to:
<ul>
<li>
decide when to send data.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
what to do if its data collides with another device's data.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
how long to wait after a collision before re-transmitting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is CSMA/CD?</h2>

<p>Carrier sensed multiple access with collision detection (<b>CSMA/CD</b>)
is the MAC used by non-switched ethernet. It is easier to explain the CSMA/CD
concept by looking at each phrase:
<ul>
<li>
<b>carrier sensed </b>--
each device that wants to send data along the shared media &quot;listens&quot; to
the media to detect if it is in use by other users.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
<b>multiple access</b> --
any device can transmit if it detects that the media is clear.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
<b>collision detection</b>
-- each device monitors its data in case it collides with other data. Collisions
can occur if two devices simultaneously listen to the media, decide it
is clear and then </b><b>transmit at the same time</b><b>.</h2></li>
</ul>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>When a device transmits data, it <b>encapsulates</b>
the data into a <a HREF="framepac.htm">frame</a> with the destination
address at the head of the frame. The frame is then <b>broadcast</b>
onto the media. All other connected devices detect the broadcast. Each
device reads the address at the head of the frame, but will only read the
whole frame if it recognises its own address in the header. Once the frame
has been read, the device responds to the source (the source address is
also in the frame header). The response could tell the source that the
data was received successfully, or that it was corrupt and re-transmission
is neccessary.

<p>Once a device has transmitted data, it monitors
its progress across the media. If the device detects that the transmitted
data is different from the monitored data, a collision is assumed to have
occurred. To ensure that other devices involved in the collision are aware
that a collision has taken place, the detecting device transmits a <b>random
bit pattern</b>. This random pattern is known
as a <b>jam bit</b>
or <b>jam sequence </b>and
it effecively &quot;kills&quot; the corrupted frames. The devices involved in the
collision then enter a <b>randomly determined
wait-state</b>, sometimes referred to as a <b>binary
exponential back-off</b>, prior to attempting
the re-transmission of the affected frames. The back off is simply a randomly
calculated period of time that can increase if successive collisions occur.

<p>CSMA/CD is an excellent solution to the problems
of shared media access, but its use is problematic when a network is heavily
loaded. When the media is heavily congested, a higher proportion
of frames can be corrupted. This is particularly noticeable in networks
operating at a high bit rate (100BaseT). <a HREF="switch.htm">Switched
ethernet</a> technology has been developed to overcome the limitations
of CSMA/CD.
