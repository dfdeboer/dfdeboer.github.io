<p><h2>What did I use?</h2>

<p>I have listed the texts that have been extremely useful during the
construction of the site. Using the books listed below, trawling the internet
and bothering my lecturers has enabled me to present the tutorial that
you see before you.

<p>There are so many books that I haven't mentioned simply because they
didn't present the information that I wanted, in the way that I wanted
it. Have a look for yourself, but be warned - don't expect them to agree
on anything! There are alot of books that date quickly and even more that
don't make any sense.

<p>As for the internet, I think that my <a HREF="hyperlin.htm">hyperlinks</a>
present a good cross-section of what's out there. Unfortunately, the search
engines have been either extremely useful or totally frustrating. All the
usual suspects - Yahoo, Lycos and Infoseek are sometimes interesting, but
they tend to return too many commercial sites that are a waste of time.
<a HREF="http://www.euroferret.com">Muscat Euroferret</a>, <a HREF="http://www.hotbot.com">HotBot</a>
and <a HREF="http://www.northernlight.com">NorthernLights</a> have been
much better. They are often faster and they allow the user to quickly tailor
the search to their needs.

<p>The quality of internet information, both in terms of presentation
and content, is mixed. I think that you can get a better overview with
a combination of books and the web.
