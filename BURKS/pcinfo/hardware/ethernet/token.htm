<p><h2>What is token ring?</h2>

<p><img SRC="images/anitoken.gif" ALT="AniToken.gif" NOSAVE BORDER="2" HEIGHT="390" WIDTH="359">
<p>Although
token ring can trace its origins back to the 1960s, <b>IBM</b>
has been responsible for much of the development since 1981. IBM made an
agreement with Texas Instruments to jointly develop the required chipsets
to support a token-passing access methodology.

<p>The <a HREF="standorg.htm">IEEE</a> became involved with the standardisation
of token ring when it ratified the <b>802.5</b> standard
for token passing. Token ring was originally based on <b>shielded
twisted pair</b> media, but it can operate over <b>unshielded
twisted pair</b> and <b>fibre optic</b>. Some
manufacturers are hoping to develop token ring so it can use <b>legacy
coaxial installations</b>. It is hoped that this will persuade organisations
to migrate from older <a HREF="ethernet.htm">ethernet</a> to token ring
without having to change their wiring infrastructure.

<p>A single computer has to act as a monitoring station for each ring.
The monitoring station does not require any extra hardware or software,
all other computers are designed to act as standby monitors if the primary
device fails. Monitors are responsible for the destruction of frames not
removed by their source computers. Any damaged tokens also have to be renewed
by the monitor.

<p>There is a great deal of discussion concerning the advantages of
token ring over ethernet. <b>Ethernet has a greater
market share</b>, but much of this is due to the <b>higher
cost of token ring hardware</b>. There have been many studies that contrast
the performance characteristics of ethernet and token ring. CSMA/CD causes
a performance tail-off, under high network loading, due to the increased
number of collisions and retransmissions. Conversely, token ring does not
perform as well under low loading - the monitoring and managing overheads
are proportionally greater. Overall though, there is not a great difference
in the two architectures.

<p>Token ring is a <b>deterministic architecture</b>
that commonly runs at <b>16Mbps</b>. It optimises
its bandwidth through the token passing access methodology. Each network
device can use the full bandwidth as soon as it possesses a special circulating
24 bit packet (token):
<ul>
<li>
When a computer wishes to transmit, it has to receive the circulating
token.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
The computer modifies the token into a frame and transmits data.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
The frame circulates to each device on the way to its destination. Each
device examines the address field of the frame to determine if the frame
is destined for itself. No other station will attempt to transmit, they
recognise that the frame is not the token.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
When a frame arrives at its destination, it is copied, processed and
retransmitted slightly modified. The modification is designed to inform
the source computer that the data has been received and processed.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
When the source computer receives its modified frame, it removes the
frame from the ring and ,either completes its data transfer, or releases
the token back onto the ring so that other devices may communicate.</li>
