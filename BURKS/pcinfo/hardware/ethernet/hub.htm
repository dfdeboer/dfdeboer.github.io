<h2>What do they do?</h2>

<p>A hub is essentially a multi-port repeater, (a repeater receives
digital data, regenerates the signal and then re-transmits the data.) Therefore,
hubs are a subset of repeaters - they receive data and then repeat it out
of all ports. Hubs can be purchased in many different configurations with
a fixed number of ports. Hubs are utilised in star physical topologies,
hence have one PC per port.

<h2>How do they do it?</h2>

<p>Hubs can support different <a HREF="media.htm">media</a> types -
ethernet can operate over unshielded twisted pair, shielded twisted pair,
thick and thin co-axial cable and fibre optic. This ability to support
multiple media types enables the integration of network segments, having
different cabling, with relative ease.

<p>It is possible to &quot;daisy-chain&quot; hubs with a cross-over cable or via
a special port that allows data to be repeated to an adjacent hub. Should
a workgroup require a quantity of computers beyond the number of ports
supported on its hub, another hub could be daisy-chained to the existing
one.&nbsp; Daisy-chaining is sometimes referred to as &quot;cascading&quot; or &quot;stacking&quot;
and makes such ethernet installations easily extensible.

<p>All traffic must pass through the hub, therefore it is an ideal piece
of equipment to interrogate for network traffic information. Some are marketed
as &quot;<a HREF="managed.htm">managed</a> hubs.&quot; These devices can be supplied
with software that allows a local console to monitor and manage its performance.
If a hub is part of a massive network installation, it may be advantageous
if it shared information with network management systems such as Hewlett-
Packard's OpenView or Sun's SunNet Manager. Managed hubs can share information
via Simple Network Management Protocol - SNMP operates at the application
layer of the <a HREF="tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> suite.

<p>As a signal travels down a line, its amplitude decreases. This is
known as signal attenuation, it increases as a function of transmission
frequency. Attenuation has to be reversed by repeating (amplifying) the
signal. Since a signal comprises multiple frequencies, attenuation results
in distortion. Hubs have to be designed to amplify different frequencies
by different amounts.
