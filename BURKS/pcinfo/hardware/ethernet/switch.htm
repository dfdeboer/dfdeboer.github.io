<p><h2>What is switched ethernet?</h2>

<p><img SRC="images/switch.jpg" ALT="Switch.jpg" NOSAVE BORDER="2" HEIGHT="108" WIDTH="303">
<p>Switched
ethernet is a packet-switching technology that <b>dramatically
reduces the network congestion</b> caused by using the CSMA/CD <a HREF="mac.htm">medium
access control</a> over shared media. Sometimes known as a <b>switched
hub</b>, a switch offers guaranteed bandwidth per port and operates
at the medium access control sublayer of the network access layer of the
<a HREF="tcpip.htm">TCP/IP protocol suite</a>.

<p>The introduction of switching can overcome congestion, due to the
non-deterministic nature of CSMA/CD, by <b>dynamically
routing frames</b> across networks. Don't confuse switches with <a HREF="router.htm">routers</a>
- strictly speaking, switches are layer two devices and routers operate
at layer three. Just to confuse matters, layer three switches are being
developed to support the growing needs of large corporate intranets. The
first generation of layer 3 switches were known as <b>High
Function</b> switches. These devices employed a mixture of hardware
switching and software routing. This represented a compromise because the
performance benefits of switching were sometimes lost with the reliance
on slow software. The new generation of layer three switches route using
hardware only.

<p>A switch will examine the incoming <a HREF="framepac.htm">frame</a>'s
MAC header to determine the physical address of the destination device.
Whereas a <a HREF="switch.htm">hub</a> simply repeats an incoming frame
out of all its ports, the switch creates a <b>virtual
path</b> to forward frames to the port where it knows the destination
device exists.

<p>CSMA/CD is no longer required, each device on a switched network
has guaranteed access to the media through the switch. Switches can also
provide some flow control to network traffic by temporarily storing frames
in a buffer. Flow control is necessary when switches are used between clients
operating over 10BaseT and servers using 100BaseT.

<p>Switches can also generate <b>backpressure </b>to
cause transmitting devices to wait long enough for the switch to deal with
backlogged traffic. To create backpressure, the switch broadcasts false
collision detection signals to cause network interface cards to back off.
It is ironic that switches must sometimes mimic the <b>CSMA/CD</b>
access methodology that they negate.</h2>

<p>In order to operate effectively, switches maintain their own MAC
look-up tables. These table illustrate which network device is at which
port on the switch. The look-up tables are constantly updated. When a switch
is newly installed, it will construct its table via an <a HREF="tcpippot.htm">Address
Resolution Protocol</a> (ARP) broadcast. ARP is a <a HREF="tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a>
layer 3 protocol.

<p>The animated gif image shows the essential
difference between a switch and a hub. Note how the switch routes the frame
to the right hand segment, whereas the hub merely repeats the frame out
of both ports.

<h2>What sort of switches are there?</b></h2>

<p>There are three sorts of layer 2 switches:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Cut-through switches</b>.
These switches only examine the address in the MAC header. The switch consults
its <b>MAC address look-up table</b>
to decide which port to forward the frame to. It then creates a <b>virtual
link</b> (point-to-point connection) and forwards
the frame. Cut-through switches do not examine the frame's check sequence
(<b>cyclic redundancy check</b>)
to ascertain if it is corrupt, therefore they can <b>forward
corrupted data</b>. The destination will then
request a retransmission. This, and the resultant retransmission will increase
network traffic.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
<b>Store and forward switches</b>.
A store and forward switch <b>reads the whole
incoming frame into a buffer</b> and calculates
its own frame check sequence. The switch then <b>compares
its CRC figure to the frame's CRC</b>. If the
two CRCs are the same, the switch will consult its address look-up table,
create the virtual link and then forward the frame. <b>Store
and forward is slower than cut-through</b>, but
it won't forward corrupted frames.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
<b>Error-free cut-through switches</b>.
These switches <b>read the MAC address and the
CRC for each frame</b>. If the CRC is correct,
the switch configures its port for cut-through (fast) switching. If the
CRC is incorrect, the switch configures its port for store and forward
(error-checked) switching. As the amount of corrupted frames diminishes
to a pre-set threshold, the switch will reconfigure the store and forward
port back to cut-through.</li>
</ul>
