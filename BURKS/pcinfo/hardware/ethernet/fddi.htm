<p><h2>What is FDDI?</h2>

<p><img SRC="images/fddi.gif" ALT="FDDI.gif" NOSAVE BORDER="2" HEIGHT="342" WIDTH="394">
<p>FDDI
is a LAN technology offering <b>100Mbps</b> data
transmission rates over <b>two counter-rotating fibre
optic rings</b>. Whereas <a HREF="ethernet.htm">ethernet</a> uses CSMA/CD
as its <a HREF="mac.htm">medium access control</a> methodology, FDDI uses
modified <b>token passing</b>. FDDI's MAC methodology
is slightly different to that of <a HREF="token.htm">token ring</a>. Token
passing guarantees that a transmitting network device has <b>full
bandwidth</b> by ensuring that transmission can only take place once
it possesses a <b>24 bit packet known as a token</b>.

<p>Each computer or group of computers can be assigned different amounts
of bandwidth, known as<b> synchronous bandwidth allocation</b>
(SBA). Frames are transmitted in a continuous (synchronous) stream and
are prioritised according to the predefined SBA. Any spare network capacity
can be filled by devices transmitting as and when they can (asynchronously).

<p>FDDI is not standardised by the IEEE, instead it was ratified by
the <b>American National Standards Institute</b>
(ANSI) X3T9.5 committee in 1984. It is known for its reliability which
comes, in part, from the use of fibre optic <a HREF="media.htm">media</a>.
Fibre optic is not subject to interference from electromagnetic or radio
sources. One fibre ring is known as the <b>primary</b>,
the other is a <b>secondary</b> ring that is used
if the primary fails. Both rings are attached across a single controller.
FDDI can support <b>500 connections</b> with the
total <b>circumference of the ring nearing 200 kilometres</b>
(if repeaters are used every 2 kilometres). <b>CDDI</b>
(copper distributed data interface) has been developed to support the functionality
of FDDI over copper media. Copper wiring cannot support the 2 kilometre
segments of fibre, but it can offer the same speeds (100Mbps) over 100
metre segments.

<p>Computers can access the rings either by a <b>single
access controller</b> or a <b>dual access controller</b>.
As the names suggest, a single access controller&nbsp; attaches to one
ring, whilst dual access controllers attach to both rings. Single access
is cheaper, but the attached computer loses the redundancy benefits afforded
by dual attachment. FDDI is interconnectable with ethernet across <b>FDDI
bridges</b>.
