<br><h2>What is ethernet?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Ethernet is a <b>baseband</b> networking technology
that has been defined by various <a HREF="standard.htm">standards</a>.
A baseband technology devotes the entire <b>bandwidth</b>
of the media to one channel. Simplistically, bandwidth can be defined as
a measure of network capacity - the greater the available bandwidth, the
greater the network's resilience to loading. The inclusion of the word
&quot;base&quot; in 10BaseT, 10Base5 etc., simply refers to ethernet's baseband nature.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
There are no levels of priority for transmission. All computers on an
ethernet network are considered equal in terms of their access to the media.
In contrast to <a HREF="token.htm">token ring</a>, there is no monitoring
station that controls the network.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
Unless it is <a HREF="switch.htm">switched</a> :</li>

<ul>
<li>
ethernet uses carrier sensed multiple access with collision detection
(CSMA/CD) as its method of <a HREF="mac.htm">medium access control</a>.</li>

<li>
data in the ether is accessable to all connected devices.</li>

<li>
high loading on a LAN segment can lead to <a HREF="framepac.htm">packet</a>
collisions and a marked drop in network efficiency.</li>

<li>
ethernet has a broadcast logical topology - data is sent to all nodes
on the network simultaneously:</li>

<li>
As shown in the diagram, ethernet is the most dominant LAN technology:</li>


<p><img SRC="images/piechart.jpg" ALT="PieChart.jpg" NOSAVE BORDER="2" HEIGHT="251" WIDTH="411" ALIGN="RIGHT">The
figures represented in the pie chart are relatively out of date, although
ethernet still remains the most common LAN architecture. <a HREF="atm.htm">ATM</a>
has become important as a LAN technology in areas of the computing industry
where high data tranfer rates are required. Multimedia, computer graphics
and video conferencing all need fast networks, therefore ATM is a good
choice, but the emergent <a HREF="future.htm">gigabit ethernet</a> may
challenge ATM.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Ethernet conforms to the <a HREF="osi.htm">OSI model</a> and covers
<b>layer 1 - physical</b>, and <b>layer
2 - datalink (medium access control)</b>.<br>
<br></li>

<li>
Interfaces have been developed to connect all types of computer, across
many types of <a HREF="media.htm">media</a>, to ethernet. PCs use a <a HREF="nic.htm">network
interface card</a> to manage <a HREF="mac.htm">medium access control</a>
and communicate with the layer 2 process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Give me some examples!</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b>10Base5</b>. Commonly
known as <b>thick ethernet</b>,
it is characterised by its thick coaxial cable (<b>RG-8</b>).
A <b>viper-tap</b> is
required to pierce the tough outer armour, allowing a computer to connect
via an interface card. It operates at <b>10Mbps</b>,
with a maximum segment (between repeaters) length of <b>500
metres</b>. Thick ethernet is largely a legacy
installation, but it was once used as a <b>LAN
backbone</b> - a backbone is usually an installation
in a bulding from which segments radiate. 10Base5 uses a<b>
bus</b> physical <a HREF="topology.htm">topology</a>.<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>10Base2</b>. Commonly
known as <b>thin ethernet</b>,
<b>thinnet</b> or <b>cheapernet</b>,
it is characterised by its thin coaxial cable (<b>RG-58</b>).
Thin ethernet uses <b>BNC T-piece</b>
connectors to link the interface card to the coaxial. It operates at <b>10Mbs</b>,
with a maximum segment length of <b>185 metres</b>.
Thin ethernet is also a legacy installation, having been superceded by
10BaseT and 100BaseT. 10Base2 uses a <b>bus</b>
physical topology. BNC <b>terminators</b>
are placed at the end of each segment. They prevent signal reflections
which could cause interference in the ether.<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>10BaseT</b>. Simply referred
to as 10BaseT. It uses <b>unshielded twisted
pair</b> cabling (commonly category 5 grade) and
<b>RJ45</b> connectors.
UTP cable resembles domestic telephone wire. The RJ45 connectors are American
telephone connectors. They look similar to the British connectors, although
RJ45 is a little bigger. 10BaseT operates at <b>10Mbps</b>,
with a maximum <b>100 metres</b>
segment length. 10BaseT uses a <b>star</b>
physical topology.<p>
</li>

<li>
<b>100BaseT</b>. This is
a logical progression from 10BaseT, it is fully compatible with 10BaseT
and often referred to as <b>fast ethernet</b>.
It uses <b>category 5 UTP</b>
cable, <b>RJ45</b> connectors
and operates at <b>100Mbps</b>
across a <b>star</b>
physical topology.</li>
