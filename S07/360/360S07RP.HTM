                          RESEARCH PAPER
                          --------------
The paper research paper must be on a topic (of your choice) 
related to the operation and/or the regulation of power systems.  
You must complete it in two steps, each step will be graded.  The 
first step is worth 40% of the paper's over-all grade.  The 
second step is worth 60% of the paper's over-all grade. 

First step:  THESIS STATEMENT with OUTLINE and ANNOTATED 
   BIBLIOGRAPHY 

   Do a literature search.  Based on the literature search, write a 
   thesis statement and outline.  

   Document your sources of support for your thesis statement 
   with an annotated bibliography of the relevant literature that 
   you found.  For each source, describe the essence of the 
   content and how you will use it in your paper.  (E.g.  The 
   author believes that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
   has not done its job properly.  This supports point A1 in my 
   outline.)
   
   Your annotated bibliography must include at least two peer-
   reviewed sources and at least five sources in total. Prof. De 
   Boer has an annotated list of recommended sources available on 
   the Web at 
   
   <A HREF = "../../ddb/dordtlit.htm"

Second Step: WRITE THE PAPER

   Write the paper in the style of "Analytical Writing" or in 
   the style of an "Essay of Argumentation" or as a "Position 
   Paper."  All these types of writing are defined in <I>Write 
   For College</I> (WFC) by Sebranek, Kemper, and Meyer.  See 
   sections 187, 189, 193, 198, 203, 207, 211, 216, 232, and 238 
   in particular.  WFC will be the primary reference for matters 
   of grammar and usage, but note that the content on MLA and APA 
   documentation style are not relevant to this assignment (see 
   next paragraph).  As an addendum to WFC, you should consult 
   Prof. De Boer's handout titled "Writing a Laboratory Report." 
   (Used in EGR 220.  Available on request if you do not have a 
   copy.)  In this handout, the section titled "AN ENGINEERING 
   REPORT & IMRAD" is not relevant--see the sections of WFC cited 
   above instead.

   Use "IEEE Transactions, Journals, and Letters" documentation 
   style instead of the MLA or APA styles as described in WFC.  
   This style manual is available on the web (see link below.)  
   Chapter IV of this manual is the part that applies to this 
   assignment.  On general matters of style, follow <I>The 
   Chicago Manual of Style</I>, (available in the Dordt College 
   Library) except as discussed in in the IEEE style manual.  
   There are also a number of shorter books on how to write a 
   paper.  Such books are acceptable if they are based on the 
   Chicago Style.  Two such books are <I>A Manual for Writers of 
   Papers, Theses, and Dissertations</I> by Turabian (available 
   in Dordt's Library) and <I>Words Into Type</I> by Skillin and 
   Gay.  (A particular note: IEEE style requires titles of books 
   and periodicals to be italicized, not underlined.  Titles of 
   articles in periodicals are put in parenthesis, not 
   underlined.)
   
   The IEEE Transactions, Journals, and Letters style guide is 
   available at <A HREF = 
   "http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/transactions/auinfo97.pdf" 
   >http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/transactions/auinfo97.pdf</A> 



Grading:

Your thesis with outline and annotated bibliography will be 
graded as follows: 

"A" Thesis statement has a limited and manageable scope.  It is 
    no more than three sentences and no more than 100 words.  It 
    also expresses a specific and legitimately debatable point-
    of-view.  The paper will either defend that point-of-view or 
    present an analysis of the point-of-view, describing the 
    conditions under which it is likely to succeed best and the 
    opposing points-of-view.
    
    Your thesis statement must meet the guidelines found in 
    <I>Write for College</I>.  Particularly see 024, 111, 113, 
    287, and 288.

    The thesis is grammatically correct.  

    The outline clearly supports the thesis.  (See <I>Write for 
    College</I> 116.)
    
    The bibliography contains at least two peer-reviewed sources 
    and at least five sources over-all.  At least two peer-
    reviewed sources and five sources over-all are independent of 
    each other.  (Examples of non-independent sources are two 
    sources by the same author or publisher.) 
    
    The annotations for each source show clearly the essential 
    content of the source that is relevant to your paper and how 
    you will use the source.

"B" Same as "A" above, except one or two requirements are not met 
    in full.

"C" Serious problems with the Thesis, although a good-faith 
    effort shows. --OR-- Inadequate Bibliography --OR-- A good-
    faith effort at the Outline is not evident.

"F" Serious problems with the Thesis --AND-- Inadequate 
    Bibliography. 

("Good faith" means that several of the parts of the item relate 
    logically to the context or each other.  Conversely, a list 
    of independent items or equations or quotations taken out-of-
    context, etc. show bad faith.) 

The paper itself will be graded according to the rubric in "How 
to Write a Lab Report."
