|  |       |       |       | Hint on 11-24:  The computer sets  |
|  |       |       |       | flag bits the same no matter what  |
|  |       |       |       | number format is in use.  The      |
|  |       |       |       | computer is not a person--it does  |
|  |       |       |       | not "know" what format the data is |
|  |       |       |       | representing.  In particular, the  |
|  |       |       |       | answers to parts (c) and (d) do not|
|  |       |       |       | depend in any way on the number    |
|  |       |       |       | formats in use.  The CPU treats all|
|  |       |       |       | data the same.  The programmer     |
|  |       |       |       | selects instructions based on the  |
|  |       |       |       | number formats in use.             |

|  |       |       |       | Do *11-17, also repeat 11-17 except|
|  |       |       |       | start with 0110 1000 in the        |
|  |       |       |       | register and the carry bit set to  |
|  |       |       |       | logic-1 AND reverse the order      |
|  |       |       |       | of the instructions.  In other     |
|  |       |       |       | words, the first instruction is    |
|  |       |       |       | ROLC, then RORC, etc. to SHR as the|
|  |       |       |       | last instruction.                  |

|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Also do *11-23, *11-25             |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Hint:  For problem *11-23 assume   |
|  |       |       |       | that the "16 bit register" is named|
|  |       |       |       | register "R".                      |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Hint: For problem *11-25 a computer|
|  |       |       |       | does subtraction A - B as A + (-B) |
|  |       |       |       | and treats the numbers as twos     |
|  |       |       |       | complement no matter what format   |
|  |       |       |       | they are actually in.  Then        |
|  |       |       |       | "borrow" is the NOT of the carry   |
|  |       |       |       | out of that addition.  This borrow |
|  |       |       |       | is saved in the carry flag bit.    |

|  |       |       |       | Hints:                             |
|  |       |       |       | Zero can be formed as the exclusive|
|  |       |       |       | OR of two identical words.  For    |
|  |       |       |       | example, R0 XOR R0 = 0.            |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Assume numbers are signed integers |
|  |       |       |       | in the two's complement number     |
|  |       |       |       | system.  Then                      |
|  |       |       |       |                     _              |
|  |       |       |       |         X - Y = X + Y + 1          |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | It is possible that some bits in   |
|  |       |       |       | the control word do not matter.    |
|  |       |       |       | Mark those "X" for "Don't Care."   |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Although *10-10 is not assigned,   |
|  |       |       |       | understanding that problem and its |
|  |       |       |       | solution on the web might help you |

|  |       |       |       | overbars, such as X.  The accepted | 
|  |       |       |       | conventions are to use a preceding | 
|  |       |       |       | slash, as in /X or a trailing      | 
|  |       |       |       | <u>u</u>nderscore and "n" as in X_n.  Thus| 
|  |       |       |       | X becomes /X or X_n.  In VHDL the  | 
|  |       |       |       | preceding slash is also not        | 
|  |       |       |       | supported and the X_n notation is  | 
|  |       |       |       | conventional.                      |

|  |       |       |       | <A HREF=
"http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tibpal16r4-25c.pdf"
                        >TIBPAL16L8 datasheet</A>.              |

|  |       |       |       | Hint #1:  The output pins of the   |
|  |       |       |       | TIBPAL16L8-25C are driven by       |
|  |       |       |       | inverters.  You need to build the  |
|  |       |       |       | inverse function in the array to   |
|  |       |       |       | get the true function at the output|
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Hint #2:  If you put an "X" mark on|
|  |       |       |       | an AND gate it signifies that all  |
|  |       |       |       | the fuses on all the inputs for    |
|  |       |       |       | that AND gate should remain intact.|
|  |       |       |       | This forces the output of that AND |
|  |       |       |       | gate to logic-0 always.            |
|  |       |       |       |                                    |
|  |       |       |       | Hint #3:  Tie pin 1 to ground.  Use|
|  |       |       |       | that input signal to enable outputs|
