|  |       |       |       | 3/29 the due date was changed from |
|  |       |       |       | 3/29 to 4/05.  Also problem 6.7 was|
|  |       |       |       | modified by adding, "part a only." |

|  |       |       |       | because this is assessment day.    |

|  |       |       |       | entirely retracted.  There are     |
|  |       |       |       | typographic errors in some of the  |

|  |       |       |       | *.IO file and one of these must    |
|  |       |       |       | be the "Status" signal.  Thus in   |
|  |       |       |       | the file given here PC0 is left    |
|  |       |       |       | disconnected and only 7 bits of    |
|  |       |       |       | data can be controlled by the      |
|  |       |       |       | switches.                          |

|  |       |       |       | 3.20 (not in text) How does the    |
|  |       |       |       | STAF bit in the PIOC register get  |
|  |       |       |       | set?  Can you set it with software?|
|  |       |       |       | How do you clear STAF?             |

Note 1) If a "#" follows the "returned" date, then the solution
key is posted on the cork board across the hall from room S233.

Note 2) Problems sets shown above with no "assigned" date are
tentative.  More problems might be added, expected due dates
might change, but problems shown will eventually be assigned.

Note 3) If you are having difficulty reading the latest version
of this page it may have to do with your browser's cached memory.
