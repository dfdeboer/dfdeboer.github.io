                   HOMEWORK STANDARDS</b><br>
            For Professor De Boer's Classes</p>

<P><B>Learn by Showing</B><BR>
The overall goal of doing homework is to LEARN by SHOWING HOW 
problems are solved.  To do this you need to present a clear and 
reasonably detailed sequence of rational statements to show HOW a 
problem is solved.  The correct answer is not the goal, learning 
is.  A fuzzy presentation with too many skipped steps may be 
interpreted as a lack of understanding on your part and may be 
graded down accordingly. </p><p> 

Your grade will be based on HOW WELL YOU SHOW how to solve the 
problem, not simply on the final answer.  </p><p>

Some texts give some answers so that you may check your method of 
solution.  Especially when the answer is in the textbook, be sure 
your homework solution demonstrates HOW to solve the problem.  
Given answers will not count toward the grade.  (After all, you 
could have just copied the answer.) </p><p>

<B>Type of Paper</b><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   --Use letter size paper (about 8.5" x 11")<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   --Legal size paper is not acceptable. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   --Paper ripped out of a spiral binder is not acceptable unless<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   you use a scissors to neatly cut off the ragged edge. <BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   --Engineering paper is recommended but not required. 
<BR></P><P>

<B>Use a Pencil</B><BR>
Mistakes are expected.  By using a pencil you can erase your 
mistakes and save the grader the effort of looking through 
scratched-out lines.  You will spend enough time on the homework 
to justify good quality equipment.  A<BR> 0.5 mm mechanical 
pencil (e.g. Pentel brand or equivalent) and a white plastic 
eraser (e.g. Pentel "Click") will pay for themselves with time 
saved.  This equipment is available at the Dordt Bookstore and at 
other local merchants such as The Pencil Box and Walmart. </P><P> 

<B>Page Heading</B><BR>
Put the course number, problem set number, date, and your name at 
the top of each sheet of paper.  Example:<BR>
EGR 999
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PS#99
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
9/9/99
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<B>Neat Page Layout</B><BR>
Start each new problem at the top of a new page.  (Exception: if 
the problem is short enough to finish it on the same page you 
started it.)  Write legibly.  Consider using white space to set 
off important parts of the problem or answers.  Boxes and 
underlining can also be helpful for the grader.  You may be 
graded down if the grader has difficulty deciphering what you 
have written or finding an answer. </P><P> 

<B>Problem Summary Required</B><BR>
Start each problem with a summary of the problem statement.  As 
an alternative, you may photocopy the problem statement page, cut 
the problem statement out of the photocopy, and paste it onto 
your homework.</P><P>

<B>One Side Only</B><BR>
Use only one side of each sheet of paper (do not write on the 
back side of the paper).  Exception: computer-printed pages may 
be printed on both sides in order to conserve paper. </P><P>

<B>Units</B><BR>
When the problem statement includes units (seconds, volts, etc.) 
then the answer should include appropriate units. </P><P>

<B>Significant Digits, No Leading Decimals</B><BR>
Use an appropriate number of significant digits for your answers 
(often 3 digits unless the answer is obviously an integer 
quantity) and use engineering or scientific notation 
appropriately.  Do not allow leading decimals.  (Right: 0.125    
Wrong: .125) </P><P>

<B>Graphs--Label Axes and Make 'em BIG</B><BR>
Graphs should be an appropriate size.  If the graph is an answer, 
this usually means at least two inches high and 3 inches wide.  
It is also necessary that the graph be appropriately scaled.  If 
you can cover the interesting area of the graph with your thumb, 
the graph is either too small or not scaled appropriately.  
<B>Title</B> the graph and <B>label both axes</B> with 
<B>quantity</B> and <B>units</B> where appropriate.  See Figure 1 
below.</P>

<B>Figure 1.  An example of a properly labeled graph that is 
large enough.</B></P><P>

<B>Proofs (Also "Show," "Explain," "Derive," Etc.)</B><BR>
Engineering is about people, ideas, creativity, etc.  It is not 
simply applied math and science.  This means that an engineering 
proof needs to expose the thought process used to establish the 
believed truth of some statement.  Generally, you cannot do a 
proof by computer because the computer does not expose the 
thought processes, it only gets "the right answer."  When you are 
asked to prove something, be sure to name the appropriate 
principles and theorems and show how they fit together to 
establish that which is to be proved.  Note:  words like "show," 
"explain," "derive," etc. usually mean the same thing as "prove." 
</P><P>

<B>Use of Calculators and Computers</B><BR>
Use calculators and computers appropriately to perform routine 
and tedious operations and calculations.  If you will not be 
allowed to use a calculator during the tests, consider doing more 
calculations by hand so that you are prepared better for the 
tests.</P><P>

You may be graded down for using a calculator or computer to do a 
trivial operation.  (For just one example, you should know that 
sin(0) = 0 without needing a calculator.)  Your professor's 
experience is that calculators and computers are sometimes used 
inappropriately for non-routine symbolic work that you don't know 
how to explain.  Computers are ideal for producing clear and 
accurate graphs, but for some reason are not used as often as 
they could be for this purpose, in Professor De Boer's opinion. 
</P><P>

If you use a computer (e.g. Mathcad) to help you solve a problem, 
you must print the file and staple it to your homework. If you 
write a program (Visual Basic, Java, Matlab, etc.) print the 
source code (use a fixed pitch font if you have a choice) and 
print the output of the program too.  Missing a printout?  
Credit may be denied! </P><P>

If you use an unusual feature of your calculator, say an equation 
solver, definite integral solver, or matrix inverse operator, 
make a marginal note.  (e.g. "Used matrix inverse on my TI-89 
calculator.")  If you use such a feature repeatedly, you only 
need to note your method once, near the first instance. </p><P>

<B>Reference Books</B><BR>
If you use a table of integrals or trig. ID or a theorem or other 
such material from a reference book, you need to cite the source.  
(e.g. "Used table of integrals in calc. book by Edwards & Penny, 
4th edition."  Subsequent citations can be even shorter, e.g. 
"Integral Table.")  Since this is homework, a full citation (such 
as in IEEE or APA or MLA style) is not important if your 
classmates could reasonably find your source from the information 
given. </P><P>

<B>Do Your Own Work</B><BR>
Professor C.S. Lewis was once asked by another professor what he 
did about plagiarism.  Here is his advise, which Prof. De Boer 
follows:  
<blockquote>
   [I only once detected a pupil cheating.]  I told him I was not 
   a detective nor even a schoolmaster, nor a nurse, and that I 
   absolutely refused to take any precaution against such a 
   puerile trick; that I'd as soon think it my business to see 
   that he washed behind his ears or wiped his bottom.  He 
   [dropped out] of his own accord the next week and I never saw 
   him again.  I think you ought to make a general announcement 
   of that sort....  It is bad for them to think this is "up to 
   you."  Flay them alive if you happen to detect them; but don't 
   let them feel that you are a safeguard against the effects of 
   their own idleness.  What staggers me is how any man can 
   prefer the galley-slave labour of transcription to the 
   freeman's work of attempting [the assignment] on his 
   own.<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                 --Letter from Lewis to Dr. Alastair Fowler,<BR> 
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                   December 10, 1959.</I> 
</blockquote>

Working from another student's paper, or from an e-mail or a 
computer file that essentially contains the solution, or using 
someone else's graded homework from a previous offering of the 
course are just a few ways to commit plagiarism.  Professor De 
Boer also counts giving such information as plagiarism.  Keep 
your papers and computer files private.  The only times when you 
may legitimately share are during peer grading in class (if peer 
grading is offered) and any work done in connection with a team 
in the lab, in which case the team may share any of their own 
materials among themselves whenever the result will be a single 
project or lab report. <P></P> 

Students may discuss homework and other aspects of the class 
among themselves at any time outside of class.  Such discussions 
should be verbal or text-based e-mail only.  It is OK to tell a 
friend that, "You need to use such-and-such a theorem to solve 
that problem."  It is not OK to show your friend your solution.  
If your friend is really stuck, you should probably refer him or 
her to the course instructor for help anyway--that's what they 
are here for.  </P><P>
