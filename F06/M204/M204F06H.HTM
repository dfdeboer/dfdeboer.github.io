|38| 12/08 | 12/11 |       | Read 5.7                           |
|  |       | 12/13 | 12/14#| Pg 241 Ex 4, 5                     |

|  |       |       |       | Note:  Technically in each of      |
|  |       |       |       | Ex 4 and 5 one should multiply     |
|  |       |       |       | the given functions by H(t), the   |
|  |       |       |       | Heavyside function.  This is       |
|  |       |       |       | because the Laplace transform is   |
|  |       |       |       | one-sided or in other words, the   |
|  |       |       |       | Laplace transform assumes that f(t)|
|  |       |       |       | g(t) etc. are zero for all t < 0.  |
|  |       |       |       | Thus, where the text states for    |
|  |       |       |       | example that f(t) = t, one should  |
|  |       |       |       | actually work with f(t) = t*H(t).  |
|  |       |       |       | In practice, it makes no difference|
|  |       |       |       | to the answers you get, so long as |
|  |       |       |       | t > 0.                             |

|  | Use the dfield solver (linked from the course web page).   |
|  | To get full credit your solution must show a dot at each   |
|  | initial condition (and no other dots that would confuse the| 
|  | matter).  You may set initial conditions and place the dots| 
|  | by setting initial conditions from the keyboard.  In the   |
|  | "Direction Field" Window, from the top menu click on       |
|  | "Solution" and then "Keyboard input of initial value."     |
|  | Alternatively, you may click your mouse on the direction   |
|  | field plot in order to select an initial condition.  If    | 
|  | you do this, be sure to write down the coordinates of the  |
|  | initial condition (from the lower left corner of the       |
|  | window) just before  you click.  After printing, use a     |
|  | pencil to annotate the plot with the coordinates of the    |
|  | initial condition(s).  The bigger you make the direction   |
|  | field plot on your computer screen the more accurate you   |
|  | can be with your mouse cursor.  Any reasonably close       | 
|  | results will get full credit.  You may put Ex 1 - 4 on one |
|  | plot and Ex. 5-8 on another plot.  Label each solution with|
|  | the Exercise number.                                       |

|  |       |       |       | Hint on #10:  The motion is one-   |
|  |       |       |       | dimensional.  When the displacement|
|  |       |       |       | is positive the force needs to be  |
|  |       |       |       | negative and when the displacement |
|  |       |       |       | is negative the force needs to be  |
|  |       |       |       | positive.  This is what, "...but   |
|  |       |       |       | opposite..." means in the problem  |
|  |       |       |       | statement.  See also the <A

Note 1) Most odd-numbered exercises have answers in the Appendix 
at the back of the textbook.

Note 2) Homework must be ready for peer grading and discussion in 
class on the first listed due date.  It must be turned in for a 
final grade on the second listed due date.  Peer grading will be 
1/5 (20%) of the homework grade.

Note 3) If a "#" follows the "returned" date, then the solution
key is posted on the cork board across the hall from room S233.

Note 4) Problems sets shown above with no "assigned" date are 
tentative.  More problems might be added, expected due dates 
might change, but problems shown will eventually be assigned.
