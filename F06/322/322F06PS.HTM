|  |       |       |       | Hint for 4.90:  There is enough    |
|  |       |       |       | information given to compute the   |
|  |       |       |       | overdrive voltage.  From this you  |
|  |       |       |       | can determine the region of        |
|  |       |       |       | operation even though you do not   |
|  |       |       |       | know the threshold voltage.        |

|  |       |       |       | Note on 4.86:  The coaxial cable is|
|  |       |       |       | just a (fancy) wire.  No current   |
|  |       |       |       | flows from the center conductor to |
|  |       |       |       | the shield.  The "50 ohm coaxial   |
|  |       |       |       | cable" label on the figure will be |

|  |       |       |       | For problem 4.78 a generic sketch  |
|  |       |       |       | with no numbers on the axes but    |
|  |       |       |       | with critical points labeled is    |
|  |       |       |       | desired.  The main part of the     |
|  |       |       |       | problem is the proof ("Show. . .") |
|  |       |       |       | and the sketch is intended to      |
|  |       |       |       | illustrate the proof.  An initial  |
|  |       |       |       | sketch might be easier to make if  |
|  |       |       |       | you assume numeric values for the  |
|  |       |       |       | transistor's parameters, but keep  |
|  |       |       |       | the proof and final sketch generic.|

|  |       |       |       | Read Chapter 1 thru Section 1.5    |
|  |       |       |       | Refer to Appendix C and your       |
|  |       |       |       | EGR 220 textbook as needed.        |

+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Note 1) The text includes "Exercises" embedded throughout the 
reading assignments and "Problems" at the end of each chapter.  
All the assignments refer to "Problems" unless they are prefixed 
with "Ex".  Example:  Ex1.5 is found on page 10 but 1.5 is found 
on page 51.

Note 2) A "+" mark in front of the problem number means an answer 
is in the text, in Appendix H.

Note 3) The letter "D" in front of a problem number indicates a 
design oriented problem.  The student may need to use some 
judgment in understanding what the problem statement is 
requesting.  (Ask Prof. De Boer if you are in doubt.)

Note 4) Asterisks (*) indicate more difficult or more time-
consuming problems.  The more asterisks, the more difficult.

Note 5) If a "#" follows the "returned" date, then the solution
key is posted on the cork board across the hall from room S233.
Solution keys will usually be posted shortly after homework is 
returned. 

Note 6) Problems sets shown above with no "assigned" date are 
tentative.  More problems might be added, expected due dates 
might change, but problems shown will eventually be assigned.

Note 7) If you are having difficulty reading the latest version
of this page it may have to do with your browser's cached memory.
Read this <A HREF=
"../../ddb/NOTES00.HTM">note on cached pages</A> to solve the problem.
