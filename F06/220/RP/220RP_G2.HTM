<H2>Grading Part Two of the Research Paper</H2>

<P><B>"A"</B><BR>
All deficiencies in the thesis statement and bibliography have 
been fixed.  (See the grading rubric for part one and your graded 
copy of part one.)  The outline includes an introduction and a 
conclusion each of which contain content as specified in the 
booklet "How to Write a Lab Report."  The outline clearly shows 
the major headings you will use and it shows how the thesis will 
be defended and how the bibliography will be used.  

<BR><P><B>"B"</B><BR>
One or two of these problems:  Thesis still does not meet 
the specification of part one.  Bibliography still does not meet 
the specifications of part one.  Outline does not contain an 
introduction and conclusion.  Outline does not show how the 
thesis will be defended.  Outline does not show how the 
bibliography will be used. </P> 

<BR><P><B>"C"</B><BR>
More than two of the problems described above although a good-
faith effort shows. --OR-- inadequate bibliography showing 
insufficient improvement from part one.</P> 

<BR><P><B>"D"</B><BR>
(This grade will not be given.)</P>

<BR><P><B>"F"</B><BR>
Anything less than a "C"</P>

(Evidence for "Good faith" effort includes the logical 
relationships between elements of the outline, showing 
thought and consideration of the subject and supporting the 
thesis.) </P>
