|  |       |       |       |   finite numeric computations,     |
|  |       |       |       |   Matlab has a command called      |

|  |       |       |       |   used.  Do those by hand.         |

 * = A computer is highly recommended for solving this problem.

Notes: To save a copy of a *.m file, right-click the link and 
       then click on something like "save target as. . ." (the
       exact procedure depends on your web browser.)

       To read a *.m file with it's original formatting, after 
       clicking on the link select "View | Source" or similar 
       command from the top menu bar of your browser.  (If this
       exprience does not prove the value of white space, which
       browsers typically remove, nothing will.)

     (Some of these may have been fixed in later printings.)

p 64, Fig 2.2.4(d).  The "+" sign should be a "x" sign.

p 176, Fig. 3.8.  There should be no zero at |z| = a.  You could 
       take a to be located at an angle of 45 degrees and remove 
       that zero.

p 268, Equation on second line of the page.  Change the last 
       exponent from "j(w-pi/2)" to "j(w-pi)/2".

p 305, Table 4.6  In the expresion for x(n) that is one panel 
       down in the left column, replace the second instance of 
       "|n| <= L" with "|n| > L".

p 531, In the equation closest to the center of the page, replace 
       " - 12.90" with " + 12.90" in the first numberator.

p 523, Figure 7.22(b).  Change the -12.9 coeffieient to +12.9.
