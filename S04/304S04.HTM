   Ch 1 Sections 1.1, 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9.
   Ch 2 Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
   Ch 3 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
   Ch 4 Section  4.1 plus class notes on interrupts.
   Open Book, Open Notes, a calculator was recommended.
   Handed back on 3/04.

Test #2, Thursday, 4/8  The test will cover the following:
   Ch 6 (all of Ch. 6)
   RS-232, Ethernet, and USB--from class notes (Ch 7 in your 
      text also contains some of this info.) 
   Ch 8, Sections 8.1 and 8.2.
   The test will be open book, open notes.  
   A calculator is required. 
   
Final Exam, Thursday, 5/6, 8-10 AM.
   Will cover all the material covered on tests #1 and #2 plus 
   the remainder of chapter 8.  It will also cover position 
   sensing (relative, direction, absolute, Grey code, V-scan).  
   The exam will be open book, open notes, and a calucator is 
   required.

    The above link was discovered by Matt Veenstra.  Prof. De 
    Boer recommends especially the later chapters on programming 
    and peripherals.  The language in this book Motorola specific.
    For example, what they call an, "I/O memory location," is 
    generally known as a "memory mapped I/O port."  Other than
    these types of issues, the info in the book is generally 
    applicable to all microcontrollers.
