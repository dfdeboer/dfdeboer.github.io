|  |       |       |       | Either Mathcad or Matlab would be  |

|  |       |       |       | and above 1 Megohm are impractical |
|  |       |       |       | to build.  To design an inverting  |

|  |       |       |       | ground.  To design a non-inverting |
|  |       |       |       | amplifier, connect x to b and a to |
|  |       |       |       | ground.  The "resistance at        |
|  |       |       |       | terminals x-y seen by the          |

                           TEXTBOOK ERRATA           (last update
                           ---------------               4/28/04)
First, see the author's list at 
   <A HREF="http://www.clarkson.edu/~svoboda/errata/6th.html">http://www.clarkson.edu/~svoboda/errata/6th.html</A>

In addition, there are the following errata:


Page 168, Table 5.6-1, method 2, part c,
   add "Zero all independent sources, then" between the
   "(c)" and the pharase "Connect a 1-A current source. . ."
   The edited phrase will read:
      "Zero all independent sources, then connect 
      a 1-A source from terminal b to terminal a.  
      Determine Vab.  Then Rt = Vab/1."


Page 186, Problem P5.6-4, answer is i   = 1.13 A, ("A" not "V").
                                     sc

Page 285, Problem P7.7-1  There are at least two ways to fix this 
   problem. 

   1.) In the problem statement, change "mA" to "A" and "ms" to 
   "s".  In particular, the line that starts with "where" should 
   read:  "where the units of time are seconds and the units of 
   current are Amperes."  After, "The units of p(t) are W and the 
   units of w(t) are J." add "Time, t, is in seconds." 


   2.) Alternatively: change the answers to match the given 
   units. Then 

          /
          | 0         if t <= 0
          |
   p(t) = | 1.6t      if 0 < t < 0.001
          |
          | 0         if t >= 0.001
          \

          /         
          | 0         if t <= 0
          |     2
   w(t) = | 0.8t      if 0 < t < 0.001
          |       -5
          | 8 x 10    if t >= 0.001
          \
   
   Where in the answers, the units for p(t) are W, the units for 
   w(t) are J, and t is in seconds. 


Page 339, Problem P8.3-1, answer should be:

                              -t/750 us
                 v(t) = 6 - 2e          V, t >= 0

Page 386, Table 9.14-2, In the overdamped natural response both 
   exponents should be positive, as shown here:

                     A exp(s t) + A exp(s t)
                      1     1      2     2

Page 387, Problem P9.3-1.  The problem statement should read:

   "Find the differential equation for v  in the circuit..."
                                        C
   Also, label v  to the left of the capacitor with the "+"  
                C
   label on top.  (There are many differential equations "for the 

   circuit." The v  equation is the one sought for the answer.)
                  C

Page 387, Problem P9.3-2.  The problem statement should read:

   "Find the differential equation for i  in the circuit..."
                                        L

Page 456, Problem P10.7.3.  The unit on each current source

   should be "A" for amperes, not "V."  (Two instances.)


Page 514, Problem P11.4-4.  In the answer change 

   "I    = 5 mA" to "I    = 4.33 mA"
     rms              rms

   Alternatively, change the illustration to show half cycles of
   sin(wt) instead of full cycles of 0.5*(A - Acos(2wt)) for the 
   non-zero portions of the waveform.  Then the correct answer 
   will be 5 mA. 
   
                              
                              TESTS        (Last update: 5/11/04)
                              -----

Test #1, Wednesday, 2/25. The test covered Chapters 1 through 
   4 and through section 5-4 of Chapter 5. Preparation to solve 
   systems of linear algebraic equations with at most three 
   unknowns was expected.  Closed book, closed notes.  A 
   calculator was allowed (and recommended).  Handed back on 2/27.
   Lo = 41, Avg = 66, Hi = 98.
   Test solutions are posted along with the homework.

Test #2, Friday, 4/2.  Closed book, closed notes.  A calculator 
   was allowed and recommended.  The test covered Chapter 5 
   Section 5-5 through Chapter 7 Section 7-5, omitting the 
   sections on MATLAB (sections 5-8 and 6-9).  Material in 
   problem sets 15 through 24 and Labs 5, 6, and 8 which is 
   related to the Chapter coverage listed above was also allowed 
   on the test.  Material covered on Test #1 was prerequisite for 
   this test.  (On Wednesday, 3/24 the test date was changed from 
   3/31 to 4/2.)  Handed back on 4/7. Lo = 49, Avg = 78, 
   Hi = 100. 

Final Exam, Tuesday 5/4 from 8:00 am to 10:00 am.  Covered the 
   entire course with emphasis on each topic roughly proportional 
   to the time spent on the topic.  Closed book, closed notes.  A 
   calculator was allowed and recommended.  Knowing how to use 
   complex numbers with your calculator was also recommended.  
   Tables 9.3-1 and 9-3-2 were included on the exam as given 
   information--there was no need to memorize them.  Material 
   covered on the final exam was everything covered in the lists 
   above for Tests #1 and #2 plus all the lab handouts and 
   homework assignments, plus Chapter 7 Section 7-6 through 
   Chapter 12 Section 12-4 except for material on MATLAB, coupled 
   inductors, and transformers.  Specifically, Sections 7-11, 10-
   14, 11-9, and 11-10 were not covered on the final exam.  Raw 
   scores:  Lo = 41, Avg = 74, Hi = 89. 

Research Paper Grading is done.  Average grade was 2.8 ("C") on a 
   scale of 4.0.  The low was 0.7 ("D-"), the high was 4.0 ("A").

                         RESEARCH PAPER    (Last update: 1/21/04)
                         --------------
Assigned on the first day of class, 1/14.  

Write a paper about a person who contributed to the development 
of electrical theory.  The paper must explain what motivated the 
person to do the work done or how the person's work influenced
culture.  Some biographic exposition will be necessary, but the 
paper need not be a complete biography.

Graded in two parts:  One-third of the grade will be from a 
preliminary draft which includes the thesis, outline, and an 
annotated bibliography.  

FIRST PART, DUE 2/18
Do a literature search.  Based on the literature search, write a 
thesis statement and outline.  Turn this part of the assignment 
in when you are done.  (Any time before the due date.) 

Document your sources of support for your thesis statement with 
an annotated bibliography of the relevant literature that you 
found.  For each source, describe the essence of the content and 
how you will use it in your paper.  (E.g.  "The author believes 
that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not done its 
job properly.  This supports point A1 in my outline.") 

Your annotated bibliography must include at least two peer-
reviewed sources and at least five sources in total. Prof. De
Boer has an annotated list of recommended sources available on
the Web at <A

Your thesis with outline and annotated bibliography will be
graded as follows:

"A" Thesis statement has a limited and manageable scope.  It 
    is no more than three sentences and no more than 100 
    words.  It also expresses a specific and legitimately 
    debatable point-of-view.  The paper will either defend 
    that point-of-view or present an analysis of the point-of-
    view, describing the conditions under which it is likely 
    to succeed best and the opposing points-of-view. 

    Your thesis statement must meet the guidelines found in
    Write for College.  Particularly see 024, 111, 113,
    287, and 288.

    The thesis is grammatically correct.

    The outline clearly supports the thesis.  (See Write 
    for College 116.) 

    The bibliography contains at least two peer-reviewed sources
    and at least five sources over-all.  At least two peer-
    reviewed sources and five sources over-all are independent of
    each other.  (Examples of non-independent sources are two
    sources by the same author or publisher.)

    The annotations for each source show clearly the essential
    content of the source that is relevant to your paper and how
    you will use the source.

"B" The bibliography requirements for five independent sources 
    are met and two are peer reviewed.  One or a few other 
    requirements are not met in full. 

"C" Serious problems with the Thesis, although a good-faith
    effort shows. --OR-- Inadequate Bibliography --OR-- A good-
    faith effort on the outline is not evident.

"D" (This grade will not be given.)

"F" Anything less than a "C"

("Good faith" means that several of the parts of the item relate
    logically to the context or each other.  Conversely, a list
    of independent items or equations or quotations taken out-of-
    context, etc. show bad faith.)



SECOND PART
Write the final copy of the paper, Due 4/23 at the latest.
Turn this paper in when you are done.  (Any time before the due 
date.)  The final copy of the paper must follow the thesis of the 
first part of the work.  If you discover that the thesis is 
unworkable, you may resubmit the first part for a new first-part
grade based on a new thesis.
