GNU Octave 3.4.3 for Windows requires the Visual C++ runtime libraries. 
It is very likely that these have already been installed on your
computer by some other program and are available for Octave's 
use too.  To find out, <b>open Control Panel</b>, click on "<b>Programs 
and Features</b>" (or "Add/remove programs" on some systems) and 
look at the list of installed programs.  The runtime you need 
shows up in the list as "<b>Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable. . .</b>"
There may be several versions of this installed, which is OK.  
Just look at the list&mdash;don't make changes.  You need version 9.0
or up.  These will have the number 9.0 or up in the filename.  If the 
runtime does not show up in the list or if the number in the file 
name is less than 9.0, you will need to <a href=
"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555"
>install it</a> before installing Octave.  (Do not uninstall older
versions of the C++ runtime.)                                  <br><br>


After you have verified that version 9.0 or up of the the C++ 
runtime is installed, Point your browser at <a href=
"http://octave.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"
                               >Octave-Forge</a> and click the 
link to "Windows installers."                            <br><br>

In the list of downloadable files, click the link to the most 
recent URL that is described as being, "<b>Octave x.x.x for 
Microsoft Visual Studio</b>." this will usually be the top link in 
the list (but not the "Parent folder").  Hover your mouse 
cursor over the URL to read the complete URL if your browser 
truncates the URL names.                                <br><br>

Click on the "<b>octave-x.x.x-<some-stuff-goes-here>-setup.exe</b>" 
link to start the download.  Depending on how your browser is
set up, you may need to specify a location to save the download.
The desktop is a fine location.  The "downloads" folder will also work 
but might later entail more mousing around.               <br><br>

If the file's destination is automatic in your browser, then 
when the download is complete open the download window and then  
double-click the "<b>octave-x.x.x-<some-stuff-goes-here>-setup.exe</b>" 
file to start the installation.  If you needed to specify the
download location, open "My Computer" or "Windows Explorer" and
drill to the location and then double-click the file.     <br><br>

After the installation is complete you may delete the 
"<b>octave-x.x.x-<some-stuff-goes-here>-setup.exe</b>" file.<br><br>

Hint:  If Octave seems to be hung, try typing "q".  <br><br>

The "help" feature in Octave sometimes calls a Linux program (now 
ported to Windows) called "less."  Less has a colon, ":" prompt.  
If you see that prompt (or any time you are in "less") you 
can exit to the Octave command prompt by typing "q" (for quit).  
The "less" program allows the help file to be displayed page-by-page.
You can use arrow keys and page-up, page-down keys to scroll
through the help file that gets displayed.  Linux and Unix 
users will feel right at home doing this.  Windows users might 
feel confused until they try it for a while.  For more information
about less, see the "<a href=
"http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl1_less.htm"
>less man page</a>." ("More about less"&mdash; 
don'tcha just love the language of Linux stuff?) <br><br>

Hint: The proper way to exit GNU Octave is to issue the 
"exit" command at the Octave command prompt. You can also
"kill" Octave by using the Windows red X "close window" 
button, but after you kill it Windows will probably then report
that Octave is "not responding" and then allow you to clean
up the mess (remove it all from memory).  Better to "exit"
and let Octave clean itself out of memory.  <br><br>

The main GNU Octave Web site is <a href=
"https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">here</a> (or click the logo 
above).<br>
The non-Linux installers for GNU Octave are separate "projects" hosted 
on various servers.  "<a href=
"http://octave.sourceforge.net/"
>Octave-Forge</a>" is a project to build 
installers for Windows and Apple operating systems.
