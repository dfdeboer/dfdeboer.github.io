<H1>Notes on DDB's web pages</H1>

Note 1:  To be sure your browser is giving you a view of the most<BR>
recently posted page, flush your cache.<BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
      In Netscape: press ctl-R after loading each page.<BR>
      In Internet Explorer: press F5 after loading each page.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Either of the above steps will flush only the page you are viewing from <BR>
your cache, replacing that page in your cache with fresh information. <BR>
All other cached pages remain unchanged.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Note 2:  To get back to the page you came from, use the "back" feature<BR>
of your browser.  (Click the icon with a left-pointing arrow on it or <BR>
try alt-leftarrow on the keyboard.) 
<BR>
<BR>
Note 3:  Dordt College supports Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6.0 only.  If you are <BR> 
using Netscape and can't get the page to display correctly or if you are <BR> 
getting out-of-date pages, try Internet Explorer instead. </BODY> </HTML>
