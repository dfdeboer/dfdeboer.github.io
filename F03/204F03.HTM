  INTRODUCTION TO MICROPROCESSORS AND DIGITAL CIRCUITS, EGR 204
                           (Fall 2003)
                      
Here's the "<A HREF="http://www.powersof10.com/p10_day/p10play.html">Powers-of-Ten</A>" video shown in class on 10/17.
Click on "Dial-up Connection" or "Broadband Connection" to play 
the video.

The <A HREF="204F03SY.DOC">course syllabus</A> is available as an MS Word document. 

Click this <A HREF="NOTEF03.HTM">note on cached pages and handouts</A> if you are 
having difficulty seeing the latest version of this page.

MAX+PLUS II Student Edition Software for simulating digital 
logic, running VHDL code, and more, is available for downloading.  
Installation is a bit tricky, but not if you follow the 
instructions to the last nitpicky detail.  Read them first. 
1. Read all the <A HREF="http://www.altera.com/support/software/download/altera_design/mp2_student/ins-student.html">instructions</A> but don't do them just yet.
2. Get a <A HREF="http://www.altera.com/support/licensing/lic-university.html">license file</A>.  Choose "MAX+PLUS II Student Edition 
   software" and select "Version 10.2, 10.1, or 9.23"  You will 
   probably be asked for your hard disk serial number.  You can 
   find that by opening a DOS window and issuing the DOS command 
   "dir /p" (don't include the quotation marks).  On some 
   computers the only way to open a DOS window is from the start 
   menu. Click Start/Run... and type "Command" or "CMD" in the 
   dialog box, then click "OK." 
3. <A HREF="https://www.altera.com/support/software/download/altera_design/mp2_student/dnl-student.jsp">Download Max+Plus II (~50 MB)</A> 
   or borrow the CD on reserve in Dordt's Library.
4. Place both the license file and the executable installation 
   file in the same directory.  Run the installation from this
   directory.  Install the software to this directory.  Install 
   the software according to the <A 
   HREF="http://www.altera.com/support/software/download/altera_design/mp2_student/ins-student.html">instructions</A>.

   
                          
                             HOMEWORK                Last update:
                             --------           12/15 at 10:16 am 
Homework must conform to these <A 
HREF="HWSTDF03.HTM">standards</A>.

Problems in the text marked with an astersik (*) have solutions
available at <A 
HREF="http://cw.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/mano/">http://cw.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/mano/</A>

Note 1) Homework must be ready for discussion in class on the 
first listed due date.  It must be turned in for a final grade on 
the second listed due date.  

Note 2) If a "#" follows the "returned" date, then the solution
key is posted on the cork board across the hall from room S233.
Solution keys are generally posted soon after the homework is 
returned.

                              -----               12/12 12:30 pm)
Test #1, Monday, 10/20, Covered all sections in Chapters 1-3
which were assigned for reading above.  (Note that sections 3-13
and 3-14 were omitted from the test.)  The test was closed
book, closed notes, no calculators allowed.  The test was handed
back on Wednesday, 10/29.  The low raw score was 48, average was
74, high was 91 (out of 100).

Test #2, Wednesday, 11/19.  Covered all the assignments from 
Chapters 4 and 5 plus the assignments from Chapter 6 Sections 
6-1 through 6-6. The test was closed book, closed notes, no 
calculators allowed.  The low raw score was 34, the average was
70, the high was 98 (out of 100).

Final Exam, Tuesday, 12/16 10:30 am - 12:30 pm.
Covered all assignments (the whole course).  About 2/3 of the 
exam was over the material covered by tests #1 and #2 (problem 
sets 1 through 27).  The remaining 1/3 of the exam was over 
problem sets 28 through 35.  The test was closed book, closed 
notes, no calculators allowed.  Tables of assembly instructions, 
similar to those in the Z-80 handout were supplied with the Final 
exam as needed.  The grading of the exam was finished on 12/22.  
The low raw score was 50, the average was 72, the high was 94.

Course grades were turned in the the registrar on 12/23.

                       PEER GRADING RUBRIC    (Added to this page
                       -------------------                 10/01)
The purposes of peer grading are to. . .
    (1) provide motivation for keeping up with the course, and
    (2) to help each other learn how to solve problems, and
    (3) to learn how to communicate our findings to others.

"A" The work shows a sincere effort.  The presentation of the
    work shows how the problem was solved.  I can read it without
    difficulty.  (Correctness is not required.)

"B" The work shows a sincere effort but is incomplete.  Or, the
    work does not show all of what I would like to know about how
    the problem was solved.  Or, the work is hard to read, but
    mostly readable with effort.

"C" Something is there and some sincere effort is shown.

"D" (This grade is not allowed)

"F" Nothing is there.  (The student would have no basis upon
    which to participate in class discussion.  The Prof. gives 
    this grade since nothing was turned in for peer grading.)

Plus and minus grades are not allowed.  Comments from the peer
grader to the student being graded are encouraged.  Please write
them on the back of the page or in the margin so that the student
may correct mistakes without re-copying the work.

                   ERRATA LIST for the TEXTBOOK      Last Update:
                   --------------------------10/01/03 at  5:14 pm

This list is for the "Second Edition, Updated, 3rd printing."  
     
To find out if you have this version, first look on the cover for 
"2ND EDITION UPDATED" in red print under the title.  Then turn to 
page ii (the page before the table of contents) and look for a 
list of numbers like "10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3."  The last digit, "3" in 
the example above, is the printing.  (Each time the book is 
printed, one of the numbers in this list is removed.)  

Kime (an author of this book) also maintains <A HREF 
="http://cwx.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/mano/chapter0/custom2/deluxe-content.html">other lists of errata</A> 
for this book, including other editions and printings. 

p222 Fig. 4-28 Labels on two flip-flops are missing.  Starting at 
     the "FJKC" labels and going clockwise, the labels are Q, 
     CLR, CK, K, J.  Each label to be placed inside the box that 
     represents the flip-flop.  Also note: the use of the 
     inverter at the output of the lower flip-flop is poor 
     practice.  Use the Qbar output of the flip-flop instead. 
     A corrected figure is contained in <A 
HREF="http://www.woodchuckimages.com/mano/errata_up_2.pdf">Kime's errata list</A>.

p289 line 13 from the top, change "$" to "=".  Optional:  Add a 
     marginal note: k = log(base2)(m).

p300 line 7 from the bottom.  Change "32800" to "32783" and 
     change "608" to "591".  (2^15 AND gates + 15 inverters = 
     32783 gates.  2^9 AND gates + 9 inverters + 2^6 AND gates + 
     6 inverters = 591 gates.  Compare to Fig. 3-13, p112.) 

p305 last line, change "Figure 6-14" to "Figure 6-13."

p310 line 3 from bottom.  Change "PDL" to "PLD."

p320 line 12 from bottom (an equation).  
     Change "(0,5,6,7" to "(0,5,6,7)" (add a closing parenthesis) 

p375 Figure 7-20.  Change label on signal AA from "6" to "0" in 
     clock cycle 2.  Change signal BA from "0" to "6" in clock 
     cycle 2 only.  Signal BA remains "0" in clock cycles 3 and 
     4.  A crossover ("X") is missing in signal BA between clock 
     cycles 2 and 3.  A "0" label is missing from signal BA in 
     clock cycle 3.  A corrected figure appears in PDF format
