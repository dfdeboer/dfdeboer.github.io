                               -----           12/12 at  9:42 am)
Test #1 was given on Friday, 10/10.  It will covered the text 
sections listed above for problem sets 1 through 14 except it 
did not cover anything in chapter 2 of Grainger & Stevenson.
The test was open book, open notes, a calculator was allowed 
(ability to handle complex numbers with your calculator was 
recommended).  The test was handed back on 10/13.

Test #2 was given on Friday, November 21.
It will covered problem sets 15-26 and the associated text 
sections (most of Chapter 2 and all of Chapter 3).  The test was 
open book, open notes.  A calculator was allowed (ability to 
handle complex numbers with your calculator is recommended.)  
The test was handed back on 11/24. 

The Final Exam is scheduled for Saturday, 12/13 at 3:30-5:30 PM 
About 2/3 of the exam will cover problem sets 1-26.  The other 
1/3 will cover problem sets 27-33.  The exam will be open book, 
open notes.  A calculator is recommended.  


                          RESEARCH PAPER            (Last update:
                          --------------       11/03 at 11:11 am)
Assigned 9/12   
Thesis, outline and annotated bibliography due 9/29
Due for peer grading Wednesday, 12/3
Final paper due on Friday, 12/5

The paper research paper must be on a topic (of your choice)
related to the history, operation, or the regulation of power
systems.  You must complete it in steps, each step will be 
graded.  
    
The intermediate steps are worth (altogether) 35% of the paper's 
over-all grade.  The final version of the paper is worth 65% 
of the paper's over-all grade.  If after the thesis, outline, and 
annotated bibliography is due you abandon that work and come up 
with another unrelated thesis, the grade on the original thesis 
and bibliography may be reduced to "F."  (That work did not 
contribute to your final paper.)  On the other hand, some changes 
in thesis are to be expected based on continuing research.  Re-
wording or negating a thesis can be done with no penalty provided 
that the paper continues to rely on most of the same sources.  
Consult with Prof. De Boer if you wonder if a change will be 
allowed. 

First step:  THESIS STATEMENT with OUTLINE and ANNOTATED
   BIBLIOGRAPHY   due 9/29, grading in queue

   Do a literature search.  Based on the literature search, write 
   a thesis statement and outline. 

   Document your sources of support for your thesis statement 
   with an annotated bibliography of the relevant literature that 
   you found.  For each source, describe the essence of the 
   content and how you will use it in your paper.  (E.g.  "The 
   author believes that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
   has not done its job properly.  This supports point A1 in my 
   outline.") 

   Your annotated bibliography must include at least two peer-
   reviewed sources and at least five sources in total. Prof. De
   Boer has an annotated list of recommended sources available on
   the Web at

   <A HREF = "http://www.dordt.edu/~ddeboer/ddb/dordtlit.htm"

Second Step: WRITE 1st DRAFT OF THE PAPER
   Due for peer grading Wednesday, 12/3
   Due for grade Friday, 12/5

   Write the paper in the style of "Analytical Writing" or in
   the style of an "Essay of Argumentation" or as a "Position
   Paper."  All these types of writing are defined in <I>Write
   For College</I> (WFC) by Sebranek, Kemper, and Meyer.  See
   sections 187, 189, 193, 198, 203, 207, 211, 216, 232, and 238
   in particular.  WFC will be the primary reference for matters
   of grammar and usage, but note that the content on MLA and APA
   documentation style are not relevant to this assignment (see
   next paragraph).  As an addendum to WFC, you should consult
   Prof. De Boer's handout titled "<A HREF="F03LR.HTM">Writing a Laboratory Report</A>."
   (Used in EGR 220.  Available on request if you do not have a
   copy.)  In this handout, the section titled "AN ENGINEERING
   REPORT & IMRAD" is not relevant--see the sections of WFC cited
   above instead.

   An ABSTRACT IS REQUIRED for this paper.  The abstract must be 
   100 words or less.

   Use "IEEE Transactions, Journals, and Letters" documentation 
   style instead of the MLA or APA styles as described in WFC. 
   This style manual is available on the web (see link below.) 
   Chapter IV of this manual is the part that applies to this 
   assignment.  On general matters of style not covered by the 
   IEEE style guide, follow <I>The Chicago Manual of Style</I>, 
   (available in the Dordt College Library).  There are also a 
   number of shorter books on how to write a paper.  Such books 
   are usually easier to use then the Chicago Manual and are 
   acceptable for this assignment if they are based on the 
   Chicago Style.  Two such books are <I>A Manual for Writers of 
   Papers, Theses, and Dissertations</I> by Turabian (available 
   in Dordt's Library) and <I>Words Into Type</I> by Skillin and 
   Gay.  (A particular note: IEEE style requires titles of books 
   and periodicals to be italicized, not underlined.  Titles of 
   articles in periodicals are put in parenthesis, not 
   underlined.) 

   The IEEE Transactions, Journals, and Letters style guide is
   available at <A HREF =
   "http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs/pubs/transactions/auinfo03.pdf"
   >http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs/pubs/transactions/auinfo03.pdf</A>

   Papers written for this assignment will be eligible for 
   the IEEE Region 4 Student paper contest.  Please read the 
   <A HREF="IEEE_R4_Student_Paper_Contest_Guidelines.doc">guidelines for this contest</A>.  Grading will be based on 
   Professor De Boer's usual rubric.  Professor De Boer is 
   assuming that by meeting his grading rubric you will also do 
   well on the criteria for judging listed in the contest guide. 
   Professor De Boer's grading rubric is described in his booklet 
   "<A HREF="F03LR.HTM">Writing a Lab Report</A>."  See pages 2-6 in the Fall 2003

   IEEE Standard 315-1975 is mentioned in the IEEE contest guide.  
   It may be helpful if you need to include a schematic, however 
   most of this is intuitive.  The <A 
   HREF="http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/gsdu/315-1975_desc.html">table of contents</A> of the 
   standard is available on the IEEE web pages.  A few key
   <A HREF="http://www.iprocessmart.com/techsmart/tech_assist.htm">sections</A> are available on a different web site.  Click on 
   the page images ("Page 1", "Page 2", etc.).  These pages are 
   in GIF format.  It might be helpful to right-click on the page 
   of interest, save the GIF to your local disk, and then view it 
   in a graphics editor such as Microsoft Photo Editor.  This 
   will allow you to zoom in on parts of the page. 




Grading:


Your thesis with outline and annotated bibliography will be
graded as follows:

"A" Thesis statement has a limited and manageable scope.  It 
    is no more than three sentences and no more than 100 
    words.  It also expresses a specific and legitimately 
    debatable point-of-view.  The paper will either defend 
    that point-of-view or present an analysis of the point-of-
    view, describing the conditions under which it is likely 
    to succeed best and the opposing points-of-view. 

    Your thesis statement must meet the guidelines found in
    <I>Write for College</I>.  Particularly see 024, 111, 113,
    287, and 288.

    The thesis is grammatically correct.

    The outline clearly supports the thesis.  (See <I>Write 
    for College</I> 116.) 

    The bibliography contains at least two peer-reviewed sources
    and at least five sources over-all.  At least two peer-
    reviewed sources and five sources over-all are independent of
    each other.  (Examples of non-independent sources are two
    sources by the same author or publisher.)

    The annotations for each source show clearly the essential
    content of the source that is relevant to your paper and how
    you will use the source.

"B" The bibliography requirements for five independent sources 
    are met and two are peer reviewed.  One or a few other 
    requirements are not met in full. 

"C" Serious problems with the Thesis, although a good-faith
    effort shows. --OR-- Inadequate Bibliography --OR-- A good-
    faith effort on the outline is not evident.

"D" (This grade will not be given.)

"F" Anything less than a "C"

("Good faith" means that several of the parts of the item relate
    logically to the context or each other.  Conversely, a list
    of independent items or equations or quotations taken out-of-
    context, etc. show bad faith.)

Your final paper will be graded according to the rubric in 
   Professor De Boer's booklet "Writing a Lab Report" as 
   mentioned above.


                       PEER GRADING RUBRIC    (Added to this page
                       -------------------                 10/01)
The purposes of peer grading are to. . . 
    (1) provide motivation for keeping up with the course, and 
    (2) to help each other learn how to solve problems, and 
    (3) to learn how to communicate our findings to others. 

"A" The work shows a sincere effort.  The presentation of the 
    work shows how the problem was solved.  I can read it without 
    difficulty.  (Correctness is not required.)

"B" The work shows a sincere effort but is incomplete.  Or, the 
    work does not show all of what I would like to know about how 
    the problem was solved.  Or, the work is hard to read, but 
    mostly readable with effort.

"C" Something is there and some sincere effort is shown.

"D" (This grade is not allowed)

"F" Nothing is there.  (The student would have no basis upon 
    which to participate in class discussion.) 

Plus and minus grades are not allowed.  Comments from the peer 
grader to the student being graded are encouraged.  Please write 
them on the back of the page or in the margin so that the student 
may correct mistakes without re-copying the work.  

(Previous versions of this course had no Web content.)
