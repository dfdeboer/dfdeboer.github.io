|  |       |       |       | confirm your results. (Read section|

|  |       |       |       | Matlab.)  The goal is to learn why |
|  |       |       |       | each locus is shaped the way it is.|

|  |       |       |       | If there is an odd  number of -s   |
|  |       |       |       | terms in kP(s) (open loop gain)    |
|  |       |       |       | then the locus on the real axis is |
|  |       |       |       | to the RIGHT of an odd number of   |
|  |       |       |       | poles and zeros.  This happens     |
|  |       |       |       | because a "-" sign in the numerator|
|  |       |       |       | cancels the "-1" in the char.      |

|  |       |       |       | What does the sign change in G2(s) |
|  |       |       |       | do to the Bode plot.  B-8-7  Why   |
|  |       |       |       | does the Bode plot of gain have a  |
|  |       |       |       | lump in it?                        |

                             PROJECT
                             -------
On 3/27 the project was cancelled.  Grade weighting was changed 
      to 10% for homework and 30% for each test and for the final 
      exam.


                              TESTS                 (Last update: 
                              -----             5/06/02  1:35 pm)
Test #1, Wednesday, 2/15.  Covered Chapters 1-2, Chapter 3 
      sections 3-1, 3-2, 3-3 only, and convolution (from class 
      notes).  One crib sheet and a calculator were allowed.  On 
      2/11 the test date was delayed from 2/13 to 2/15.  The test 
      was handed back on 2/20. 

Test #2, Wednesday, 4/3.  Covered Chapter 3 sections 3-4, 3-5, 
      3-7, 3-8, 3-9, and all of Chapter 5.  (On 3/11 this test 
      was rescheduled from 3/13 to after spring break.  On 3/27 
      the test was scheduled for Wednesday, 4/3)  Two crib sheets 
      and a calculator were allowed.  Grading is in progress.

Final exam, 3:30 - 5:30 PM Tuesday, May 7.  
      Will cover the entire course.  Topics will be roughly 
      balanced according to the time spent on them in class. 
      The exam will cover Chapters 1 through 3 and convolution as 
      described above for the two tests, plus Chapters 5-8 except 
      it will omit coverage of these sections: 5-5, 5-6, 6-4, 
      7-5, 7-6, 8-3 through 8-11.  Three crib sheets and a 
      calculator will be allowed.  Tables 2-1 and 2-2 (pages 
      17-18 and 31) from your text will be given to you at the 
      exam.
