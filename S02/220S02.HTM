                         RESEARCH PAPER    (Last update: 4/08/02)
                         --------------
On Monday, 4/8 the research paper assignment was cancelled--your 
prof. is too busy to grade it.  In connection with this, the 
paper will now count for 0% of the course grade (it was 8%).  
Also, the weight of the homework was increased from 10% to 14% 
and the weight of the lab report was increased from 8% to 12% of 
the course grade. (The research paper was tentatively due on 
Friday, 4/19.)
