<b>A CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY?  WHAT'S THAT?</B><BR>
The course you have been invited to visit was taught 
at <a href="https://www.dordt.edu/">Dordt University</a>, 
a small private university, "in the cornfields of Iowa."  
The most distinctive aspect of this university is it's 
dedication to Christianity.  This offer to visit is not 
an explicit attempt at evangelism.  The course is  
on-target for the engineering topic you expect.  You do not 
need to be a Christian to visit.  All we ask is that you 
be respectful of our freedom to believe and we will do 
our utmost to return our respect for you, whatever you 
believe (or don't believe).  Professor De Boer's courses, 
being engineering courses, do not tread heavily into 
theology (or at least so he thinks), but be prepared for 
some times of prayer in class and some discussion as we 
relate our course to our faith.<br><br>

If you really want to get into the nitty 
gritty of Dordt University, read their "<a 
href="https://www.dordt.edu/general-uploads/educationaltask2019.pdf"
>Task</a>" and "<a 
href="https://www.dordt.edu/general-uploads/Consumer-Information/Educational-Task-and-Framework/educationalframeworkdoconline.pdf"
>Framework</a>" documents.  Those are probably <a 
href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TMI"
>TMI</a> for this context, but anyway, there you could go.<br><br>  

<b>HOW TO GET STARTED</b><br>
To find this page you have already found a URL link to grant 
you access to the course.  That same link will be your main access to 
the course.  It will lead you to a page that looks something 
like the course shown below.<br>

<p align="center">

that got you to this page to get live links.</i></p><p>

<b>YOUR FIRST DAY AT CLASS</b><br>
You might like to dive right into the first lecture of 
the semester.  Then the link similar to, "Slides and videos for 
each class period" is for you.  That link will get you to an 
index page with one line for each class period.  Each line 
in the index will have a "VIDEO" or "V" link which will get 
you to the video of that lecture.  The videos were uploaded 
directly after class with no editing.  The slides used in 
the lecture can also be separately downloaded as PDF 
files by clicking on the dates of the lectures.<br><br>

Feel free to explore all the other links to the extent of 
your interest.  If you would like to do homework, for copyright 
reasons you will need access to a textbook to get the problem 
statements.  Professor De Boer cannot grade your homework 
because he is retired now.  Depending on his schedule, Professor 
De Boer might be willing to offer helpful tips on some of 
the homework.  He tries to respond to all e-mails within a day, 
but due to retirement it sometimes takes longer.<br><br>

In some textbooks there are some homework answers available 
at the end of the Chapters, in the back of the book, or at the 
publisher's Web site.  Read the notes at the bottom of the 
course's homework page for details about the availability of 
any such answers.  If no answer is available for a homework 
problem, you might consider looking for ways to prove to 
yourself that your answer is correct.  This can sometimes be 
done by pursuing a different solution technique or by pairing 
up with a friend and seeing if your answers match.  <br><br>

<b>SAFETY and SECURITY</b><br>
There are no guarantees in this world.  Visitors should do 
their part to protect their access to the course they are 
visiting.  Professor De Boer will not be using university 
resources in service of visitors.  This means that to keep 
access for visitors free he will be using public servers 
like YouTube, InfinityFree, and Github that offer free 
hosting services.  It is not possible to maintain high 
security with these servers at this price-point ($0).  
Denial-of-service attacks and such, if they happen, could 
unfortunately result in the loss of visitor access to his 
courses.  (Students enrolled for credit have access 
to these files and courses via the university servers and 
course management system, all of which are much more secure 
and behind a paywall.)<br><br>

Trust is the foundation of truth and fulfillment in life.  
Please do your part.<br><br>

<!--"Course total" is the (useless) item that courses@dordt 
calculates willy-nilly and that you should ignore.  "CourseGrade" 
is the real deal, but only gets entered at the end of the course, 
after the final exam is graded.  -->
