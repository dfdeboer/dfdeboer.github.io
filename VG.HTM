<b>A CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY?  WHAT'S THAT?</B><BR>
The course you have been invited to visit will be taught 
at <a href="https://www.dordt.edu/">Dordt University</a>, 
a small private university, "in the cornfields of Iowa."  
The most distinctive aspect of this university is it's 
dedication to Christianity.  This offer to visit is not 
an explicit attempt at evangelism.  The course will be 
on-target for the engineering topic you expect.  You do not 
need to be a Christian to visit.  All we ask is that you 
be respectful of our freedom to believe and we will do 
our utmost to return our respect for you, whatever you 
believe (or don't believe).  Professor De Boer's courses, 
being engineering courses, do not tread heavily into 
theology (or at least so he thinks), but be prepared for 
some times of prayer in class and some discussion as we 
relate our course to our faith.<br><br>

If you really want to get into the nitty 
gritty of Dordt University, read their "<a 
href="https://www.dordt.edu/general-uploads/educationaltask2019.pdf"
>Task</a>" and "<a 
href="https://www.dordt.edu/general-uploads/Consumer-Information/Educational-Task-and-Framework/educationalframeworkdoconline.pdf"
>Framework</a>" documents.  Those are probably <a 
href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TMI"
>TMI</a> for this context, but anyway, there you could go.<br><br>  

<b>HOW TO GET STARTED</b><br>
Professor De Boer shared a URL link with you to grant 
you access to the course.  That link will be your main access to 
the course.  It will lead you to a page that looks something 
like the course shown below.<br>

<p align="center">
<img src="Canvas_common/TypicalPublicPortal.png"><br>
<i>A typical "Public Portal" for one of Professor De Boer's courses.<br>
All links in the above illustration are dead.  Use the URL
Professor <br> De Boer sent you to get a page with live links.</i></p><p>

<b>YOUR FIRST DAY AT CLASS</b><br>
You might like to dive right into the first live lecture of 
the semester.  In that case, the link that is about 
3/4 of the way down the public portal page titled, "<b>Zoom in 
to the live classroom here</b>" is for you.  This link will be 
functional from about 10 minutes before the announced start time for 
class to the end of class.  Example:  Suppose the class starts on 
Friday at 8:00 AM Central time (USA).  You live in California.
The class will start at 6:00 AM Pacific time (USA) (sorry!)  
The link will be functional from about 5:50 AM Pacific time
to the end of the class each day when class is held.  <br><br>

But maybe you don't want to watch live because the hours 
are inconvenient for you.  Then the link titled, "Slides 
and videos for each class period" is for you.  After class 
Professor De Boer will upload the Zoom recordings to YouTube 
for distribution.  He will usually do this in the late afternoon 
of his day on the day of the class or earlier if he gets a chance.  
From then on the video of the class will be available and the 
slides he used in the lecture can also be separately downloaded 
as a PDF file.<br><br>

Feel free to explore all the other links to the extent of 
your interest.  If you would like to do homework, you will 
need access to a textbook to get the problem statements.  
Professor De Boer cannot grade your homework, but he will 
post solutions after the students turn in their work.  Depending 
on his workload, Professor De Boer might be willing to 
offer help on some of the homework.<br><br>

<b>DECORUM</b><br>
If you join the live classroom your microphone and camera 
will normally be turned off when you join.  Professor De Boer
chooses this setting so that nobody is accidentally surprised 
by an open camera or microphone.  Professor De Boer
welcomes you to turn on your camera and, if you want to join 
in classroom discussion, the microphone.<br><br>

If you turn on the camera please be dressed in normal work or
school clothing and be aware of what might show in the video 
frame besides yourself, including other people that might show 
in the background, posters on the walls, etc.  If any of this 
is distracting, please keep your camera turned off.  For example, 
an occasional person walking past is OK.  A pet constantly 
begging for attention is probably not OK.  An <a href=
"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/NSFW">NSFW</a>
poster on the wall is not OK, not even if it far away from 
the camera.  Similarly, if you enter the classroom discussion, 
your language should be free of vulgarities, profanities, 
and blasphemies.<br><br>

<b>TECHNICAL STUFF</b><br>
We will be using the Zoom platform for the live classroom.  
I highly recommend that you use a laptop or desktop computer 
if you join the Zoom livestream because I have formatted my slides 
and lectures for a large screen.  (But a smartphone ought to 
connect and do something useful.)<br><br>

The Zoom "desktop client" (also works on a laptop) has a 
convenient feature called "push to talk."  If your 
microphone is turned off (muted) and you press the spacebar 
then your microphone will unmute for as long as you hold 
the spacebar down.  This is a very nice way to enter the 
discussion without contributing background noise into the 
entire stream when you are not talking. You may need to 
<a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360000510003-Using-push-to-talk"
>enable push-to-talk</a> if you want to use it.<br><br> 

<b>SAFETY and SECURITY</b><br>
There are no guarantees in this world.  Visitors should do 
their part to protect their access to the course they are 
visiting.  Please keep your access URL to yourself.  If 
others want to join the course, have them 
<a href="mailto:Douglas.DeBoer@Dordt.edu"
>email professor De Boer</a> and make their request directly.
Yes, the course's access URL is totally public and can be 
found with a well-formed Google search.  However the servers 
Professor De Boer is using will not be able to handle the 
load if the URLs go viral.  
<br><br>

Professor De Boer will not be using university 
resources in service of visitors.  This means that to keep 
access for visitors free he will be using public servers 
like YouTube, InfinityFree, and Github that offer free 
hosting services.  It is not possible to maintain high 
security with these servers at this price-point ($0).  
Denial-of-service attacks and such, if they happen, could 
unfortunately result in the loss of visitor access to his 
courses.  (Students enrolled for credit will have access 
to the university servers and course management system, 
all of which is secure and behind a paywall.)<br><br>

Trust is the foundation of truth and fulfillment in life.  
Please do your part.<br><br>

<!--"Course total" is the (useless) item that courses@dordt 
calculates willy-nilly and that you should ignore.  "CourseGrade" 
is the real deal, but only gets entered at the end of the course, 
after the final exam is graded.  -->
