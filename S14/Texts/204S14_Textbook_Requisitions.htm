<div class="title">Thank you!  Below is what you submitted to the Bookstore:</div>
<p><strong>EGR-204-01: Intro:Microprocessors</strong></p>
<p>If new editions become available before classes start, would you like to use the new editions?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>If yes, are you aware if a new edition is currently available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will the students enrolling in this course already have the textbook from a previous course that they themselves have taken?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Do you require a CD or access code, if one is available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will you be advising the students that they <strong>NEED</strong> to 
have their own textbook, that they may share a particular textbook, that
 they really don't need the textbook, or any other options you might 
share with the students?  <em>We would appreciate knowing this so that we can make a more responsible order decision on how many textbooks to order.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>The instructor expects each student to have immediate access to the course textbook at all times.</strong></p>

<p>International versions of this textbook are not the same as the 
domestic version, even if the edition numbers and cover art match. IF 
THE BOOK'S DESCRIPTION INCLUDES THE WORD "INTERNATIONAL," DO NOT ORDER, 
EVEN IF THE ISBN MATCHES. 

A few unscrupulous booksellers have put the domestic ISBN and barcode on
 a sticky address label (e.g. Avery brand or similar) and plastered that
 over the book's real ISBN number and sold the book to people searching 
on the Web for the domestic ISBN. Their description includes the word 
"international." but they use the domestic ISBN.  International versions
 have the word "international" on the title page (one of the front 
pages, not necessarily on the cover) which still allows easy 
identification of an international version when the true ISBN has been 
plastered over.  These books are made from copied pages from various 
older editions. Page numbers will not match, homework problems will not 
match, information will be out-of-date, and there will be more errata 
than in the domestic edition. Book vendors sometimes "guarantee" that 
the international version is sufficiently similar to the domestic 
version. At least in the case of this textbook this is absolutely not 
the case. What do you think--will a vendor who is willing to change the 
ISBN number actually care about equivalency and actually honor a 
"guarantee?" Once these books get into the US market they might keep 
circulating. They get sold as used books to reputable booksellers 
because the (plastered on) barcode of the ISBN and the cover art match 
the domestic version. If one of these books slips through the system 
into your hands, a reputable bookseller (who did not describe it as an 
"international" edition) will promptly exchange the book. Still, time 
and shipping expense gets wasted. Kind of a long explanation huh!? In 
this course (only this course) it has been a problem for about two 
students per semester who have ordered their textbook via the Web. The 
Dordt College Bookstore has an advantage in quality of service. They 
check their books before they go into inventory. If anything does go 
wrong they will make amends as promptly as possible and take the hassle 
out of dealing with postage, etc.</p>
