<H2>Grading Part One of the Research Paper</H2>

<P><B>"A"</B><BR>
<p>Your thesis statement satisfies this checklist:<br><br>
1.) It is no more than three sentences and no more than 100 
words.<br>

2.) It focuses on a single topic.<br>

3.) Your thesis is stated clearly and directly with correct 
    grammar.<br>

4.) It conveys a debatable perspective about the topic.<br>

5.) It directs you to write a paper about a 20th century person 
who contributed to the development of electrical theory.<br><br>

Your bibliography relies primarily on a book from a well known 
publisher or a peer-reviewed journal article. <br><br>

Your outline either defends your thesis or presents an analysis 
of the thesis, describing the conditions or assumptions under 
which it is likely to succeed best and the opposing points-of-
view. <br><br>

If you have not already taken a grammar and rhetoric class 
such as CORE 120, or if you just want a review, Prof. De Boer 
recommends either The College Writer or Write for College.  In 
The College Writer see especially pages 41, 446ff, 450.  
Equivalently, in Write for College, see 024, 111, 113, 287, and 
288. </P> 

<BR><P><B>"B"</B><BR>
The bibliography requirements are met.  One or a few other 
requirements are not met in full. </P>

<BR><P><B>"C"</B><BR>
Serious problems with the thesis, although a good-faith effort 
shows. --OR-- inadequate bibliography. </P> 

<BR><P><B>"D"</B><BR>
(This grade will not be given.)</P>

<BR><P><B>"F"</B><BR>
Anything less than a "C"</P>

(Evidence for "Good faith" effort includes the logical 
relationships between elements of the outline, showing 
thought and consideration of the subject and supporting the 
thesis.) </P>
