         The circuit shown in Figure VP 2.2 (below) is 
         used to measure the current in resistor <i>R</i> that is 
         color coded as 750 <img src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohms"> 
         with a 2% tolerance (violet, green, brown, red) and is 
         sized as 1/4 W. It is known that  
         <i>v<sub>s</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.200 V. The meter is 
         not ideal.  It has a voltage burden of 0.0800 V.  The 
         meter has an uncertainty of 0.5% of the reading plus 2d.  
         It is set to the 2 mA range.  Your lab partner expects 
         the reading to be 1.200 V/750 <img src="omega_uc.gif" 
         alt="ohms">&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.60 mA.  The reading actually 
         is 1.51 mA.                   
      </p><p>

         a.) Your partner has concluded that the actual 
         resistance of the resistor is about 795 <img 
         src="omega_uc.gif" alt="ohms">.  Do you agree?  If not, 
         what is your best estimate of the resistance?
      </p><p>

         b.) Your partner has concluded that this resistor is 
         definitely out-of-specification.  Do you agree?  Explain 
         your conclusion.
