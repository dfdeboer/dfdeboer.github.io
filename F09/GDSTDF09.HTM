          Prof. DE BOER'S GRADING METHOD</b><br>
       Applies only to Professor De Boer's Classes</p>

<P><B>Homework</B><BR>
Each homework assignment is called a "problem set" and has a 
number, e.g. "PS#5" for "problem set number five."  Each 
problem in a set is assigned a maximum number of points.  This
maximum depends on the difficulty and importance of the the 
problem.  A problem of normal difficulty and importance is 
worth five points.  Harder or more important problems get more
points and easier or less important problems get fewer points.
                                                       <br><br>
<i>One-fifth off</i><br> 
If you have a minor error such as a sign error or a 
silly math error, and if it is easy for the grader to find the
error (depends on your neatness, etc.), then you will lose about
one-fifth of the possible points or usually at least one point.  
                                                       <br><br>
 <i>Up to half credit</i><br>                                                     
If you get a problem wrong, but you have a correct start on the 
problem or in some meaninful way show a useful formula or cite 
a useful theory, then you will get about or a bit less than 
half of the possible points.  
                                                       <br><br>
<i>One-fifth credit</i><br>
If the problem is wrong and you have put some good effort into
it but actually made little progress, then you will get about
one-fifth of the available points.                     <br><br>

<i>Grading scale</i><br>
To assign a letter grade to your homework, add up all the 
points you have earned on all your problem sets and multiply
by four.  Then divide that result by the number of points 
possible.  The result is in grade points on a scale of 4.
(4.00 = "A", 3.00 = "B", etc.)
                                                       <br><br>

Example:  You got these grades--<br>
PS#1  14/15<br>
PS#2   9/12<br>
PS#3  20/20<br>
PS#4  12/14<br>
(That's all the problem sets so far in the semester, but 
more are comming.)  <br><br>

You earned 14 + 9 + 20 + 12 = 55 points<br>
There were 15 + 12 + 20 + 14 = 61 points possible<br><br>

Your homework grade points are (4 * 55)/61 = 3.61 = A-<br><br>
At the end of the semester Professor De Boer usually makes some
changes in this table.  Usually the grade points required for "A" 
grades get slightly reduced, often by about 0.05 or 0.10.  This 
makes it easier to get an "A" on your homework.  He does this 
because it is hard for an "A" student to pull up his or her 
homework score since it is nearly perfect to begin with. <br><br>

Professor De Boer does also usually increases the grade points
needed for "D" grades by about 0.10 or 0.20, again because it
is hard for a failing student to have an unusually bad day when
most of the grades are already near zero.  <br><br>

Any adjustments made apply to the class as a whole and not to 
individuals.  <br><br>

<i>The Letter Grade is NOT IMPORTANT</i><br>
The letter grade for your homework is what is used in your final 
course grade calculation.  Professor De Boer intends for this to
be a generous grade that represents the best of what you can do.
Indeed, most students do better on homework than on tests and 
papers.  Thus, you should expect your test grades to be lower 
than your homework grades.  Homework grades of "B" or less 
correlate with test grades of "F" through "C."<br><br>

If you want to get an "A" on tests and papers, Professor 
De Boer urges you to seek perfection on your homework grade.
Earn every single possible point!  The only way to (honestly) 
earn all possible points is to start your homework early 
enough so that you can ask for help if you need it, and to 
find a way to check every answer (that's extra work).  
Conversely, if you start your homework at 1:00 AM the morning 
before it is due, and then discover that you can't figure out 
one of the problems, then it is just too bad for you!  Don't 
get in that situation if you want good test grades.  <br><br>

Each semester a few students earn all possible homework points
except for missing maybe 1 out of every 50 possible points.  
That's equivalent to getting nine out of every ten homework 
problems perfect and having only a minor error on the remaining
problem.  It is possible!  With time and care more students 
could do this.

</p><p> 

Skipped steps may be interpreted as a lack of understanding on 
your part and may be graded down accordingly. </p><p> 

Especially when the answer is in the textbook, be sure your 
homework solution demonstrates how to solve the problem.  Given 
answers will not count toward the grade.  (After all, you could 
have just copied the final answer.) Oftentimes an equation will 
show how you sloved the problem, but sometimes you will need to 
explain how you solved the problem by using a sentence or two. 
</p><p> 



<B>Type of Paper</b><BR>
                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &mdash;Use letter size paper (about 8.5" x 11")<BR>
                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &mdash;Paper ripped out of a spiral binder is not acceptable unless<BR>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       you neatly cut off the ragged edge. <BR> 
                                               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &mdash;Engineering paper is recommended but not required. 
                                                      <br></p><p>
<B>Staple</B><BR>
Staple in the upper left corner if there is more than one page. 
                                                      <BR></P><P>

<B>One Side Only</B><BR>
Use only one side of each sheet of paper.  Do not write on the 
back side of the paper.  Exception:  Computer-printed pages may 
be printed on both sides in order to conserve paper. </P><P>

<B>Use a Pencil</B><BR>
Most engineering problems include too much detail to hold in your 
head without writing anything down.  Thus you need to write in 
order to think.  But then mistakes happen because you started 
writing before thinking all the way through the problem.  By 
using a pencil you can erase your mistakes.  Writing, thinking, 
writing more, erasing, re-writing, and so forth is the best and 
<i>fastest</i> way to solve engineering problems.   Keeping a 
neat and easy-to-read page by erasing and re-writing is the 
right way to work.  Write a lot and when needed, erase.<p></p>

A good quality 0.5&nbsp;mm mechanical pencil (e.g. Pentel brand 
or equivalent) and a good white plastic eraser (e.g. Pentel 
"Click") will pay for themselves many times over with time saved 
when used generously.  This equipment is available at the Dordt 
Bookstore and at other local merchants such as The Pencil Box and 
Walmart. </P><P> 

<B>Page Heading</B><BR>
Put the course number, problem set number, date, and your name at 
the top of each sheet of paper.  Example:                <BR><BR>
EGR 999
                         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
                         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
PS#99
                               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
9/9/99
                                                     &nbsp;&nbsp;
Van VanderVander</P><BR><P>

<B>Neat Page Layout</B><BR>
Start each new problem at the top of a new page.  (Exception: if 
the problem is short enough to finish it on the same page you 
started it.)  Write legibly.  Consider using white space to set 
off important parts of the problem or answers.  Boxes and 
underlining can also be helpful for the grader.  You may be 
graded down if the grader has difficulty deciphering what you 
have written or finding an answer. </P><P> 

<B>Problem Summary Required</B><BR>
Start each problem with a summary of the problem statement.  As 
an alternative, you may photocopy the problem statement page, cut 
the problem statement out of the photocopy, and paste it onto 
your homework with a glue stick.</P><P>

<B>Units</B><BR>
When the problem statement includes units (seconds, volts, etc.) 
then the answer should include appropriate units. </P><P>

<B>Significant Digits, No Leading Decimals</B><BR>
Use an appropriate number of significant digits for your answers 
(often 3 digits unless the answer is obviously an integer 
quantity) and use engineering or scientific notation 
appropriately.  Do not allow leading decimals.  (Right: 0.125,    
Wrong: .125) </P><P>

<B>Graphs--Label Axes and Make 'em BIG</B><BR>
Graphs should be an appropriate size.  If the graph is an answer, 
this usually means at least two inches high and 3 inches wide.  
It is also necessary that the graph be appropriately scaled.  If 
you can cover the interesting area of the graph with your thumb, 
the graph is either too small or not scaled appropriately.  
<B>Title</B> the graph and <B>label both axes</B> with 
<B>quantity</B> and <B>units</B> where appropriate.  See Figure 1 
below.</P> 

           <P align="center"><IMG Src="HWSTDF09/graph.gif"><BR>
       <B>Figure 1.  An example of a properly labeled <BR>
              graph that is large enough.</B></P><P><BR>

<B>Proofs (Also "Show," "Explain," "Derive," Etc.)</B><BR>
You cannot convince most people by simply telling them the 
"correct answer."  People want to know more.  Sometimes we need 
proof.<br><br> 

An engineering proof is a chain of statements leading from given 
information to a conclusion.  This chain of statements must be 
accompanied by the names of the relevant definitions, theorems, 
principles, and so forth.  (In a normal problem solution you only 
show the chain of statements, assuming the reader will recognize 
the definitions, theorems, etc. that have been used.)  Note:  
Words like "show," "explain," "derive," etc. usually mean the 
same thing as "prove." <BR><BR> 

Engineering is about technical problems in a social context.  
Engineering is not simply applied math and science.  This means 
that an engineering proof needs to convince people by exposing a 
thought process which establishes the believed truth of some 
statement.  Generally, you cannot do a proof by computer because 
the computer does not expose the thought processes, it only gets 
"the right answer."  The "right answer" alone is not convincing.  
</P><P>                                

<B>Use of Calculators and Computers</B><BR>
Use calculators and computers appropriately to perform routine 
and tedious operations and calculations.  Computers are also 
ideal for producing clear and accurate graphs.</p><p> 

You may be graded down for using a calculator or computer to do a 
trivial operation.  For some examples, you should know how to do 
simple definite integrals without needing a calculator.  You 
should also know the sines and cosines of common angles such as 
cos(0) = 1, and you should know simple exponentials and logs such 
as exp(0) = 1 and ln(2<i>e</i>) = ln(2) + 1.  Relying on a 
calcuator for these is as rewarding as watching your favorite 
video game through dirty and badly scratched sunglasses while 
someone else plays instead of playing the game yourself without 
sunglasses.</p><p>

If you will not be allowed to use a calculator during the tests, 
consider doing some homework calculations entirely by hand so 
that you are prepared better for the tests.</P><P> 

Never use a computerized symbolic math program (e.g. the 
"symbolics" menu in MathCAD or the equivalent in your calculator) 
to do work that you don't know how to check.  Students who try 
this frequently get the answer wrong and do not learn how to 
solve the problem.  Even if the answer is in some technical 
mathematical sense correct, it might be in a useless form which 
betrays your ignorance.  Example:  <i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) = 
exp(<i>it</i>) + exp(&ndash;<i>it</i>) when a useful solution is 
<br><i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) = 2cos(t). </p><p> 

If you use a computer program (e.g. Mathcad) to help you solve a 
problem, you <i>must print the file and staple it to your 
homework</i>.  If you write a program (Matlab, Java, Visual 
Basic, etc.) print the source code (use a fixed pitch font such 
as "Courier New" if you have a choice) and print the output of 
the program too.  Missing a printout?  Credit may be denied! 
</P><P> 

If you use an unusual feature of your calculator, say an equation 
solver, definite integral solver, or matrix inverse operator, 
make a marginal note.  (e.g. "Used matrix inverse on my TI-89 
calculator.")  If you use such a feature repeatedly, you only 
need to note your method once, near the first instance. </p><P>

<B>Reference Books</B><BR>
If you use a table of integrals or trig. ID or a theorem or other 
such material from a reference book, you need to cite the source.  
(e.g. "Used table of integrals in calc. book by Edwards & Penny, 
4th edition."  Subsequent citations can be even shorter, e.g. 
"Integral Table.")  Since this is homework, a full citation (such 
as in IEEE or APA or MLA style) is not required so long as your 
classmates could reasonably find your source from the information 
given. </P><P>

<B>Do Your Own Work</B><BR>
Professor C.S. Lewis was once asked by another professor what he 
did about plagiarism.  Here is his advise, which Prof. De Boer 
follows:  
<blockquote>
   [I only once detected a pupil cheating.]  I told him I was not 
   a detective nor even a schoolmaster, nor a nurse, and that I 
   absolutely refused to take any precaution against such a 
   puerile trick; that I'd as soon think it my business to see 
   that he washed behind his ears or wiped his bottom.  He... 
   [dropped out] of his own accord the next week and I never saw 
   him again.  I think you ought to make a general announcement 
   of that sort....  It is bad for them to think this is "up to 
   you."  Flay them alive if you happen to detect them; but don't 
   let them feel that you are a safeguard against the effects of 
   their own idleness.  What staggers me is how any man can 
   prefer the galley-slave labour of transcription to the 
   freeman's work of attempting... [the assignment] on his 
   own.<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                 --Letter from Lewis to Dr. Alastair Fowler,<BR> 
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                   December 10, 1959.</I> 
</blockquote>

Working from another student's paper, or from an e-mail or a 
computer file that essentially contains the solution, or using 
someone else's graded homework from a previous offering of the 
course are just a few ways to commit plagiarism.  Professor De 
Boer also counts giving such information as plagiarism.  Keep 
your papers and computer files private.  The only times when you 
may legitimately share are during peer grading in class (if peer 
grading is offered) and any work done in connection with a team 
in the lab, in which case the team may share any of their own 
materials among themselves whenever the result will be a single 
project or lab report. <P></P> 

Students may discuss homework and other aspects of the class 
among themselves at any time outside of class.  Such discussions 
must be verbal or text-based e-mail only.  These conversations 
should be along the lines of helping your colleague solve the 
problem for himself or herself.  For example, saying, "You need 
to use such-and-such a theorem to solve that problem" is OK.  It 
is not OK to show your friend your solution.  If your friend is 
really stuck, you should probably refer him or her to the course 
instructor for help anyway&mdash;that's what the instructor is 
here for after all.</P><P>

<b>Help is Available</b><br>
For occasional help, you may call Professor De Boer at his 
office (722-6245) during the daytimes or at home 
Monday through Saturday in the evenings before 10 PM (<img

If you need (or want) help more frequently, consult the secretary 
at the ASK center and request "peer tutoring." (Or fill in an 
online form to make the request, see <a 
href="https://denis.dordt.edu/offices/ask_center/">this page</a>* 
and click on the "Peer Tutoring" link in the top banner to get 
started.) Professor De Boer believes that the grade of most any 
student can be improved by about a half or a full letter grade 
simply by routine participation in the tutorial services of the 
ASK center.</p><p> 

Tutorial help is available for many 100 and 200 numbered courses 
at Dordt College, and for some other courses too, so <a
