        <P>I have been a Christian all my life.  I was born in a 
        Christian family, attended Christian schools, and 
        generally speaking, socialized in a Christian community.  
        I have two younger sisters, Ruth and Lisa.  Ruth is a 
        school counselor, and formerly did computer programming 
        as a consultant.  <A HREF 
        ="http://www.westmont.edu/_academics/departments/art/lisa-deboer.html"
        target="_blank"> Lisa</A> is a professor of art at Westmont 
        College in Santa Barbara, California.  Our mom, Agnes, 
        lives in Grand Haven Michigan.  Our dad passed way in 
        2013 (<a href=
        "http://obits.mlive.com/obituaries/grandrapids/obituary.aspx?pid=167233036"
        target="_blank">obituary</a>).
        
        <p>For two and one-half years, when I was in second and 
        third grades, my parents were missionaries. My dad was a 
        missionary doctor stationed at Takum Christian Hospital 
        in <A 
        HREF="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2836.htm" 
        target="_blank">Nigeria</A>.  At that time I attended 
        second and third grades at <A 
        HREF="http://www.hillcrestschool.net/" 
        target="_blank">Hillcrest School</A> in Jos, Nigeria.  
        (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/HillcrestSchoolAlumni/"
		>Alumni page</a><!--<a href="http://www.crestrobin.org/" 
        target="_blank">Alumni page</a>-link may be broken-->) 
        Hillcrest is a Christian boarding school, mostly attended 
        by missionary kids at the time I attended.  Since then it 
        has grown and now serves a more diversified group 
        of students. 

        <p>Upon returning to the United States my family moved 
        to Grand Rapids Michigan and I attended Christian day 
        schools.  I found that I did not exactly blend in with 
        the U.S. culture.  My vocabulary and habits were 
        no longer purely American.  I had a hard time being 
        "cool."  It was not fun, but it has also prepared me 
        somewhat to stand up for others when needed.    
        
        <p>When I was a high-school, college, and university student 
		I thought my life-story was kind of short and 
		simple&mdash;missionary kid returns to the States and tries 
		to fit in to American culture.  But as the years went by, 
		my story grew longer, and continues to get longer.  The 
		retrospective view I now have on my longer life-story makes 
		it easier to see God's providence for me and my finiteness.  
        
        <p>I did not question my faith much until I attended the 
        University of Michigan.  There I met many other people 
        and discovered the extent of skepticism that  some people 
        have for Christianity.  (I happened to also live next to 
        a Ba'hai temple that catered to university students.)  
        The challenges I experienced at the University of 
        Michigan solidified my faith.  </P> 

        <P>In particular, I really appreciate my reformed roots 
        and the catechisms.  I know that we live in a fallen 
        world, full of sin and misery.  That explains the origins 
        of troubles and difficulties we all live through.  I know 
        that I am personally delivered from my sins, and in 
        response, I want to glorify God with all of my 
        life&mdash;including my engineering career.  The Lord has 
        equipped me with various gifts, one of which is the 
        ability to do engineering, especially electrical 
        engineering.  If I had to live out my vocation simply to 
        earn money so that I could support my family and church, 
        I would feel that my life was split into two parts; work
		and everything else.  But we don't have to live like that.  
		I can use my engineering talent to bring healing and peace 
		to our broken world, to witness to others through my work, 
		and at the same time, the Lord graciously provides for 
		all my other needs, including a community of family 
		and friends around me and a salary to live on.</P> 

        <P>In the early 1980's I worked in the engineering 
        industry at Hewlett Packard Company (HP).  I worked for 
        their "Desktop Computer Division" in Fort Collins 
        Colorado, later renamed the "Systems and VLSI Technology 
        Division."  In my first project there I designed the cell 
        array for a 640 kilo-bit read only memory (ROM).  Other 
        projects I worked on include redundancy programming 
        circuits for a 128 kilobit random access memory (RAM).  
        You can see a photo of that chip <A HREF="ddb/HP_RAM_sharp.JPG" 
        target="_blank">by clicking here.</A>   I also designed 
        some standard cells for a library of clock-driver 
        circuits.  Most of these projects were for the FOCUS  
        chip set.  This was the company's internal name for the 
        set of integrated circuits that formed the CPU and core 
        architecture for the <A 
        HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_9000#Series_500" 
        target="_blank">HP 9000</A> series 500 Unix workstation 
        computers, introduced by HP in 1982.   (For example, this  
        <A HREF="http://www.hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=367" 
        target="_blank">HP9000/520</A> in the HP Computer Museum 
        contains "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_FOCUS"
        target="_blank">HP Focus</a>" chips I helped design)  
        When I left HP in 1984 to join the faculty at Dordt 
        University, my division at HP was just beginning the work 
        on the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA-RISC" 
        target="_blank">PA-RISC</A> processor.  They followed 
        this in the 1990's by partnering with Intel to produce 
        the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium" 
        target="_blank">Itanium</A> processor based on HP's RISK
        technology.  
        
        <P>I found that many of my colleagues at HP were also 
        interested in doing their work in service to our Lord and 
        Savior Jesus Christ.  (There are Christians to work with 
        in industry.)  At the same time there is the powerful 
        influence of corporate life&mdash;a focus on a broadly 
        defined corporate concept of success.  (not just 
        profit&mdash;corporate success includes community 
        service, a sense of loyalty to customers, employees and 
        business associates, etc.)  As a Christian, I sometimes 
        felt strongly called to put my oar in the water and try 
        to participate in setting the direction of that corporate 
        ship, even if only on a small issue.  I believe 
        Christians are called to serve and give direction in our 
        world, but we must do this with humility and respect for 
        others since we are all sinners.</P> 

        <P>In August of 1984 I joined the Engineering Department 
        at Dordt University.  The decision to leave Hewlett Packard 
        Company was not black and white.  In favor of staying at 
        HP was the excitement of working with state-of-the-art 
        technology in a well-respected company.  In favor of 
        Dordt was a sense that I had a special combination of 
        skills and a sympathy for what Dordt wanted to do.  After 
        arriving at Dordt, I participated in the initial 
        development of courses in digital logic, microprocessors, 
        and communication systems in the then-new electrical 
        emphasis of the engineering major.  I also met my first
		wife, Susan, through a regional Bible study group during
		my second year on the Faculty at Dordt University.
		Susan was a graduate of <a href="https://www.alextech.edu/" 
		target="_blank">Alexandria Technical and Community College</a>.</P> 

        <P>I have been active in the <!--<A 
        HREF="http://www.siouxland.org" target="_blank">--><a href=
		"https://webinabox.vtools.ieee.org/wibp_home/index/R40031" 
		target="_blank">local section of the IEEE</A> as the 
		newsletter editor for the 
        Siouxland branch of the IEEE in 1990 and 1995-2002.  In 
        1996 I was named the "IEEE Siouxland Section 
		Engineer-of-the-Year" for contributions I made to the 
		section as newsletter editor.  In August of 2002 I became 
		the chair of the local section of the IEEE.  As Chair I 
		initiated an annual Leadership Development Workshop for 
		engineers in the profession.  In January 2004 my term as 
		chair of the section expired&mdash;the term is limited by 
		the bylaws of the section, but I was glad to have been of 
        service and will continue to participate in professional 
        activities.  Professional societies, like the IEEE, are 
        another avenue where I believe Christians have a calling 
        to participate.   

        <P>In August 1991 I took a three-year leave-of-absence 
		from Dordt University to work on my Ph. D.  I did my research 
		on <a href=
        "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/568626/"
        target="_blank">shaped modulation</a>, which is a way to 
        reduce the bandwidth requirement of digital modulation 
        while simultaneously introducing some forward 
        error-correction capability into the signal.  Forward 
        error-correction allows perfect recovery of the 
        information in a corrupted digital signal.  For example, 
        an audio CD will usually play perfectly even if there 
        are some minor scratches on it because the data was 
        recorded with a forward error correction code.   In 
        August 1994 I returned to Dordt University to resume teaching 
		and to finish writing my Ph. D. dissertation.  I finished 
        that work in December of 1995.  
        
        <p>Research like that is especially rewarding.  It brought
        me closer to God.  Modulation theory is quite a 
        mathematical field&mdash;and mathematics is the way we 
        represent our understanding of one aspect of God's 
        creation.  The new insights I discovered about shaped 
        modulation therefore gave me a renewed appreciation for 
        God's faithfulness to us.  It is not obvious to me that 
        my original arrangement of a bunch of theory and equations
        should be so predictive of what actually happens.  God must
        faithfully maintain the order in the universe to to make 
        mathematical theories so useful!  I was the first person 
        in the world to discover some of the relationships 
        in nature that God designed and created.  I could talk a 
        lot more about doing basic research like that. . .   
        &nbsp; Ask me about it some day!</P> 

        <P>However, God's beautiful universe has been corrupted 
		by sin, with all its ugliness for us to experience. In 
		1993 my first wife, Susan, was diagnosed with a fatal 
		cancer during the C-section birth of our second daughter.
        A tumor was removed during the C-section and Susan survived
        the birth, but the doctors told us that she had only a 
        matter of months, to at most five years, to live.  In 1996, 
		three years after our daughter's birth, at age 36, Susan 
		died from her cancer.</P>
		
		Susan's death does not make much sense to me.  A wife and 
		mother struck down in the prime of her life would make 
		anyone ask, "what is life all about anyway?"  Were it not 
		for my Christian faith I think I would conclude that life 
		is a meaningless struggle.  The shorter Westminster 
		Catechism's first question and answer is: <BR><blockquote> 
        
             Q1: What is the chief end of man? <BR> 

             A1: Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy 
             Him forever. <BR></blockquote>

        It is our place to be beacons of light in this world, 
		in both our personal lives and our professional lives. 		
		Susan glorified God in her earthly life as a wife, mother, 
		artist, and friend of others.  That is the significance 
		of her life. All of us find our true significance only in 
		glorifying God.

        <P>In 1998 I married Marge.  She grew up in Grand Rapids 
        Michigan and went to the same high school I did, <!--

        HREF="https://www.grcs.org/academics/schools/grchs" 
        target="_blank">Grand Rapids Christian High School</A>, 
		although we did not know each other then.  After high 
		school Marge went to Dordt University.  She met her first 
		husband at Dordt University.  She had four children with him, 
		Lori, Glenn, Keith, and Lisa.  They all graduated from 
		<a href="http://westernchristianhs.com/" target="_blank"> 
		Western Christian High School</a> in Hull, Iowa.  Lori and 
		Lisa continued their studies 
		in Nursing at Calvin University in Grand Rapids Michigan. 
		Lori is a school nurse for a public school in Michigan.  
		Lisa is a nurse at a hospital in Grand Rapids.  
		Marge's son, Keith attended Western Iowa Technical 
		College and transferred to Bellview University to get a 
		degree in Criminal Justice.  Glenn went directly from 
		high school to work.  Both Keith and Glenn now work at the 
		Doon Elevator in Doon Iowa.  All four of them have found
		spouses and are married.  There are 12 grandchildren on 
		Marge's side of our family.  
		
		<p>Marge lost her first husband to a heart attack in 1994.  
		Later, in 1997 about a year after Susan had died, Marge 
		and I were introduced to each other by mutual friends.  
		When we married we each had two unmarried children 
		living at home yet, so we blended our families together.  
        
        <P>I have two daughters, Naomi and Kim, from my first 
        marriage.  Both of them are graduates of <A HREF=
        "http://www.unity.pvt.k12.ia.us/" target="_blank"
        >Unity Christian High School</A> in Orange City Iowa and 
        of Dordt University.  Naomi also has 
		a master's degree in fine arts from Iowa State University.  
		She now does artwork on commission (see her <a href=
		"http://www.naomifriend.com" target="_blank">website</a>), 
		and with her husband <a href=
        "https://www.facebook.com/friendsflowerfarm" target=
        "_blank">sells flowers on the weekends</a> at the Ames 
        farmer's market.  Naomi is also a member of <a href=

        target="_blank">Christians in the Visual Arts</a>
        <!--<a href=

        target="_blank">Christians in the Visual Arts</a>-->.  
		Kim went from Dordt University to the South Dakota School 
		of Mines and Technology in Rapid City, South Dakota.  There
		she earned a master's degree in environmental engineering.  
		She now works for the South Dakota Department of Agriculture 
		& Natural Resources in their <a 
		href="https://danr.sd.gov/OfficeOfWater/WaterRights/default.aspx" 
		target="_blank">Water Rights Division</a>.  She 
		lives in Pierre, South Dakota.  There is one grandchild on 
		Doug's side of the family.  
		
		<p>At the end of August 2021, I officially retired from the 
		faculty at Dordt University.  They made a 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG0CtrVYgS8">tribute video</a> 
		upon the occasion of my retirement.  I am now in a transition phase from 
		Dordt University to whatever new engineering opportunities I 
		find to glorify God in the future.  Certainly I am 
		aware of more volunteer opportunities for engineers than 
		I can shake a stick at!  For the next few years I plan to 
		explore some aspects of my engineering talent in a 
		direction that will enable my Kingdom service well into 
		my elder years. One of the retirement activities I'm 
		participating in is the IEEE's
		"<a href="https://r4.ieee.org/skpl/">Science Kits for Public 
		Libraries" project</a>."  I serve as the Grant Applications 
		Chairperson for this project, a very part-time role.  Exactly 
		what else I might do in retirement I do not know yet, but I 
		trust the Holy Spirit will lead me.  

        <P>In my role as a professor it was my desire to lead my 
		students to be first-rate engineers in 
        Christ's service.  I expected to offer them a combination 
        of breadth and depth in their studies that helps them ground
        their engineering talent in their Christian faith.  
        Engineering is a delightfully multifaceted career field 
        in which there are many ways to help people solve technical 
		problems.  Before Adam and Eve sinned (the fall), there would 
		have been engineering work in order to <a href=
		"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_mandate" target=
		"_blank">develop the potential of the creation</a>.  
        For example, transportation technologies are possible because
        of the resources provided in the creation.  Now, after the 
        fall, Christians can also relieve some of the suffering 
        caused by the fall.  For example, hearing aids and artificial
        prosthesis mitigate the effects of age and disease.  
		Transportation and communication technologies enable us 
		to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Commission"
		target="_blank">spread the Good News</a>. I greatly appreciate 
		Dordt University as a place where I have found a concentration 
		of Christians and resources that makes me effective 
		in Christ's service.  (Also, Hewlett Packard Company and 
		all my past employers have afforded me opportunities to 
		glorify God.)  I hope my students can say along with me, 
		that here in the engineering department at Dordt University 
		we are glorifying Christ, and every day learning to do 
		that better. </DIV>
