In this story version of the problem statements I shall repeat 
the problem statements using only words.  Although there will be 
almost no mathematical symbolism to speed your way, perhaps you 
will find hints of what the equations in the problem statements 
mean&mdash;hints that may be hard for students to pick up on 
until they gain a deeper understanding of the symbolism of the 
equations.  <br><br>

<b>Problem two-point-thirty-six.</b><br>   
Show that a set of signals comprising a set of complex exponentials
has the property that for every pair of signals of different 
harmonics (different values of |<i>n</i>|) the pair is orthogonal
(one signal has no projection on the other signal) and that each
signal has a power of 1 W (relative to 1 &Omega;).  For example if
one signal has <i>n</i> = 2 and the other has <i>n</i> = 3 the
two signals are orthogonal and each signal has power of 1 W.  
But this needs to be proven for any pair of harmonics having 
different |<i>n</i>|.  Hint:  represent one of the signals
in a pair as &radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline">(1/<i>T<sub>0</sub></i>)</span>exp(<i>j</i>2<img src="pi.gif" alt="&pi;"><i>mt/T<sub>0</sub></i>)
and the other as <br>&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline">(1/<i>T<sub>0</sub></i>)</span>exp(<i>j</i>2<img src="pi.gif" alt="&pi;"><i>kt/T<sub>0</sub></i>)
where <i>m</i> and <i>k</i> are integers, possible values for <i>n</i>, 
and |<i>m</i>| &ne; |<i>k</i>|.
<br><br>
<b>Problem two-point-thirty-nine-point-one and also -point-four.</b><br>
Determine the Fourer Series expansion of the given signal.  
(The answer is a set of <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> values.)<br><br>
