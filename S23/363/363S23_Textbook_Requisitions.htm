Students may purchase either an <a href=
"https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/fundamentals-of-communication-systems/P200000003375/9780137848706"
>electronic version of this textbook directly from the publisher</a> 
or the hardcopy version using the ISBN number shown above.<br><br>

EACH STUDENT NEEDS ACCESS TO A TEXTBOOK<br>
Plan for open book tests. Books, calculators, etc. may not be shared 
during a test.  For the purpose of viewing an e-book, a laptop computer 
is allowed during open-book tests.<br><br>

INTERNATIONAL EDITION, GLOBAL EDITION NOT SUPPORTED<br>
"International" editions or "Global" editions of the textbook will not 
be supported by the instructor.  Often the vendor assures that an 
international edition is interchangeable with the domestic edition. It 
has never worked that way in Professor dDB's experience.  Although 90% 
of the book may be the same, usually the problem sets are different, 
page numbers don't match the domestic edition, and overall it is a 
headache to use such a book.<br><br>

PAPERBACK EDITIONS NOT SUPPORTED<br>
In Professor dDB's experience the paperback editions of this textbook 
are always an international or global edition.  See above on editions 
"not supported."<br><br>

CDs, ACCESS CODES NOT NEEDED<br>
The textbook required for this course does not require access codes to 
Web pages. The book does not come with a CD or other disk.<br><br>

NCEES approved CALCULATOR RECOMMENDED, NOT SHAREABLE<br>
Attempting a test or the final exam without a stand-alone "scientific" 
calculator will compromise your grade.  Routinely using an NCEES 
approved calculator will give you an advantage on the Fundamentals of 
Engineering tests.  The NCEES approved list can be found here: 
<a href="http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/">http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/</a>
Not all calculators on the NCEES list can do complex number calculations.  
In this course (and some other engineering courses) a calculator that 
can handle complex numbers is helpful.  The TI-36X-Pro model can do 
complex number calculations and is the choice of most engineering 
students at Dordt University.  Also in this category of top-level 
performance are the HP 35s, Casio fx115ES PLUS, and the Casio fx991ES 
Plus C.  Calculators may not be shared during tests.  Any stand-alone 
calculator is allowed in this course but only NCEES approved calculators 
are allowed on the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam.  Smartphone or 
computer resident calculators (even if on the NCEES list) and the use 
of a Web-search engine (e.g. Google) as a calculator are not allowed 
on tests in this course or on the Fundamentals of Engineering exam.<br><br>
