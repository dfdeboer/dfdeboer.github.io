<b>(No Requisitions)</b>  The textbook for this course and the associated 
lab (EGR 304L) is available <a href=
"https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/books/leeseshia/releases/LeeSeshia_DigitalV2_2.pdf"
>free online</a>.<br>
Required Textbook:  Lee and Seshia, <a href=
"https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/books/leeseshia/"><i>Introduction to 
Embedded Systems: A Cyber-Physical Approach, 2nd Edition</i></a>
MIT Press, 2017.<br><br>

EACH STUDENT NEEDS ACCESS TO A TEXTBOOK<br>
Plan for open book tests. Books, calculators, etc. may not be shared 
during a test.  For the purpose of viewing an e-book, a laptop computer 
is allowed during open-book tests.<br><br>

NCEES approved CALCULATOR RECOMMENDED, NOT SHAREABLE<br>
Attempting a test or the final exam without a stand-alone "scientific" 
calculator will compromise your grade.  Routinely using an NCEES 
approved calculator will give you an advantage on the Fundamentals of 
Engineering tests.  The NCEES approved list can be found here: 
<a href="http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/">http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/</a>
Not all calculators on the NCEES list can do complex number calculations.  
In this course (and some other engineering courses) a calculator that 
can handle complex numbers is helpful.  The TI-36X-Pro model can do 
complex number calculations and is the choice of most engineering 
students at Dordt University.  Also in this category of top-level 
performance are the HP 35s, Casio fx115ES PLUS, and the Casio fx991ES 
Plus C.  Calculators may not be shared during tests.  Any stand-alone 
calculator is allowed in this course but only NCEES approved calculators 
are allowed on the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam.  Smartphone or 
computer resident calculators (even if on the NCEES list) and the use 
of a Web-search engine (e.g. Google) as a calculator are not allowed 
on tests in this course or on the Fundamentals of Engineering exam.<br><br>
