Assignment for Thursday, December 14<br>
<b>Consolidation 2 Meeting</b><br>
1.) On Thursday 12/14 we will meet with the entire CORE 399 group 
in room SB1606 (the "big room") for a <u>required</u> (not optional) 
"Consolidation 2" meeting with all mentor groups.  This will be 
the last regular CORE 399 class of the semester, after which your "Task" 
reflection paper will be due at the last minute of the semester. <br><br> 

2.)  After class at 11:54 PM on Thursday, 12/14 (literally the last
minute of the semester) your "Reflection Paper" on our "Thrifty" topic
will be due.  This one particular reflection paper will be weighted 
as 15% of your course grade. Please turn the paper in electronically 
by clicking this link: "<a href=
"https://dordt.instructure.com/courses/2217247/assignments/15904587"
>Thrifty" Response Paper</a>. This response paper has a new grading 
rubric with different length and content requirements. The rubric 
was given on an earlier date <a href=
"#M5_rubric">here</a>.<br><br>

3.) If you have not already done so, <u>Please fill in the <a href=
"https://dordt.campuslabs.com/courseeval/"
>course evaluation for our "Thrifty" Mentor Group</a></u>.
There are two evaluations related to our CORE 399 Course.  
The one labeled "<b>CORE 399L (01)</b>" is the one you want to finish
for this particular assignment.  As you respond to it, keep in mind
that it is <u><i>only</i> directed at your evaluation of our "Thrifty" 
mentor group, Prof. De&nbsp;Boer, and the related activities (meetings 
in Room SB2732, and our presentations to the other groups)</u>. 
Prof. De&nbsp;Boer will not be grading your participation in this 
course evaluation, and will never be given the names of those who 
did or did not participate.  However Prof. De&nbsp;Boer requests the 
courtesy of your participation because these evaluations 
matter to him.  (Policies regarding participation and coverage for 
evaluations of other courses may vary to the amount the professor 
has discretion.)<br><br>

4.)  If you happen to notice the other evaluation related to 
CORE 399 and have not filled it in yet, you may fill that one 
out too, but keep in mind that that evaluation is about everything 
in CORE 399 except our "Thrifty" mentor group and Prof. 
De&nbsp;Boer, unless otherwise specifically stated.  (Update:  
Apparently this evaluation will not be offered this year.  
At least to Prof. De Boer's knowledge, no students in the 
"Thrifty" group have so far been offered the opportunity to 
fill this evaluation out.  If this evaluation is available to you
then you should be able to find it in a list <a href=
"https://dordt.campuslabs.com/courseeval/">here</a>.)<br><br>

5.)  The link to the CORE 399 course syllabus on the main 
CORE 399 Canvas page appears to be broken.  Here is a new link
to the <a href=
"https://dordt.instructure.com/files/118965741/download?download_frd=1"
>CORE 399 Syllabus</a> for you to use in case you desire to 
see the syllabus.  Prof. De Boer advises that in most courses,
this one included, the course syllabus can help you prioritize
and target what you should be studying for the final exam.<br><br>

6.)  There will be a final exam from 8 to 9 AM on Thursday, 
December 21.  This exam and any related take-home portion will 
be administered by Prof. Roth.  Please address any questions 
you may have about this exam to Prof. Roth.  Some information
about the exam is available near the bottom of <a href=
"https://dordt.instructure.com/courses/2114423/pages/exam-information"
>this Canvas page</a>.  This final exam and your course 
evaluations are the last requirements for this course.  There 
will be no more assignments.

<wbr id="M5_rubric">This response paper will have a new grading rubric with 
<u>different length and content requirements as follows</u>:  <blockquote>

<i><u>Grammar and Style</u></i><br>
Conforms to either APA or MLA style (your choice,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    but use only one style in your paper).<br> 
Is between 700 and 1400 words long.<br>
Is double-spaced between lines.<br>
Has about one inch margins all around<br>
Would print neatly on letter-size paper.<br>
Uses portrait format.  (long edge is vertical)<br>
The start of each paragraph is indented.<br>
Uses a 10-point Times-Roman or similar font.<br>
Is free of grammar and spelling errors.<br><br>

<i><u>Content</u></i><br>
Responds to these three prompts:<br><br>

<u>a.</u> Briefly summarize your <u>personal, nuanced stance</u> in relation to your mentor group's question. Include personal growth, including any disagreement or clarification you might want to express. <br><br> 

<u>b.</u> Describe the status quo position on your topic in culture today, including any historical/cultural background that has contributed to this status quo.<br><br>

<u>c.</u> Advise the Christian community.  What advice would you give Christians to improve the Church's position on your question?<br><br>

It may help to imagine that you are giving a 10-minute radio spot or briefing your church council about this issue.<br><br>

<i><u>Accuracy</u></i><br>
Every sentence in the paper is logically true, or acceptable 
poetic license, or obvious hyperbole (for effect presumably)
or follows from something said in the presentation, or from 
some author's claim, which you have cited.  <br><br>

<i><u>Overall Grade</u></i><br>
In each category you will get an "A" if all the rubric items
are met.  You will get a "B" if most are met.  You will get 
a "C" if a good-faith effort shows.  You will get a "D" if something
is there beyond rubbish.  You will get an "F" if nothing is 
turned in or if what was turned in meets practically none of
the rubric's requirements.  The lowest category grade will 
count for 50% of the paper's grade.  The other two category 
grades will each count for 25% of the paper's grade.  (Note that it 
does not matter if the professor likes your paper or not.  It
matters that you logically explain and defend your responses to 
the three content prompts, and do so with style.)</blockquote>

"https://dordt.instructure.com/files/117296355/download?download_frd=1"
>Fighting fair</a>" paper before class</u> on Thursday, 11/16.  
Reading this paper should prepare you to better understand the 
presentation you will hear on Thursday. <br><br> 

3.) At 12:25 PM on Thursday, 11/16, the entire "Thrifty" mentor 
group, all 27 of us, will attend the "Fighting Fair" group's 
presentation in <u>room SB1606</u>.  <u>Take notes in class 
during the presentation</u>.  Your notes will be helpful during 
the following discussion and to help you write a "discussion 
response paper."  <br><br>

4.) After the presentation (Approximately 12:45 PM) we will 
all return to our mentor group classroom,  SB2732.  About 
eight students from the "Fighting Fair" mentor group will join us 
and lead us in a discussion of the presentation we just heard.  
Use your notes to help you engage with the discussion leaders 
and thus <u>glean content for your "discussion reflection paper</u>"
 on "Fighting Fair."
<br><br>

5.) After class you will be assigned to write a discussion 
response paper on "Fighting Fair." It will be due before class at 
12:25 pm on Tuesday, 11/21, the same time as the discussion response
paper on "Failure" is due.  Please turn in your response paper 
electronically by clicking this link: <a href=
"https://dordt.instructure.com/courses/2217247/assignments/15649275"
>Discussion Response Paper on Fighting Fair</a>.  Your response 
paper will be graded according to the <a href="#PM1_rubric">same 
rubric</a> as the previous response paper was.<br><br>
    
6.) This pattern will repeat for all the remaining presentations, 
except that roles will be changed when our group does our presentation.
The discussion response papers for the "Race", "Hospitality" and a
paper on our own "Thrifty" topic will all be due on Tuesday,
12/12.  Reduce your "dead-week" stress by keeping up with 
writing the related response papers shortly after each presentation
while your memory of the presentation is fresh.

Assignment for Tuesday, November 14<br>
<b>Presentation 1 Meeting&mdash;<i>Failure</i></b><br>
1.) The "Failure" group's synopsis paper is available <a href=
"https://dordt.instructure.com/files/117190121/download?download_frd=1"
>here</a>.  It is also available via an attachment to an e-mail 
you should have received on Saturday, 11/11 at about 1:54 PM.  
(This web page contains everything in that e-mail as well as 
your mentor group's grading rubric, and the link for turning 
in this assignment electronically, as mentioned in the e-mail
from Professor Roth.)  Please <u>read the "Failure" paper 
before class</u> on Tuesday, 11/14.  Reading this paper should 
prepare you to better understand the presentation you will hear 
on Tuesday. <br><br> 

2.) At 12:25 PM, the entire "Thrifty" mentor group, all 27 of us, 
will attend the "Failure" group's presentation in <u>room SB1606</u>.  
<u>Take notes in class during the presentation</u> on Tuesday.  
Your notes will be helpful during the following discussion 
and to help you write a "discussion response paper."  <br><br>

3.) After the presentation (Approximately 12:45 PM) we will 
all return to our mentor group classroom,  SB2732.  About 
eight students from the "Failure" mentor group will join us 
and lead us in a discussion of the presentation we just heard.  
Use your notes to help you engage with the discussion leaders 
and thus <u>glean content for your "discussion reflection paper</u>"
 on "Failure."
<br><br>

4.) After class you will be assigned to write a "discussion 
response paper."  It will be due before class at 
12:25 pm on Tuesday, 11/21.  Please turn the paper in 
electronically <a href=
"https://dordt.instructure.com/courses/2217247/assignments/15623500"
>here</a>. <wbr id="PM1_rubric">Your paper will be graded according 
to this rubric:<blockquote>
    
<i><u>Grammar and Style</u></i><br>
Conforms to either APA or MLA style (your choice,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    but use only one style in your paper).<br> 
Is between 360 to 700 words long.<br>
Is double-spaced between lines.<br>
Has about one inch margins all around<br>
Would print neatly on letter-size paper.<br>
Uses portrait format.  (long edge is vertical)<br>
The start of each paragraph is indented.<br>
Uses a 10-point times-roman or similar font.<br>
Is free of grammar and spelling errors.<br><br>

<i><u>Content</u></i><br>
Responds to these three issues:<br><br>

<u>a.</u> What is your response to this mentor group's (be sure to identify it) thesis?  Do you accept their argument, reject it, want to refine it in some way? <br><br> 

<u>b.</u> Which aspects of the paper, presentation, discussion, or implementation project were most compelling to you?  List at least two examples.  Issues may have been compelling whether you agreed with them or not.  (What most caught your attention?)<br><br>

<u>c.</u> How could you see implications of this topic affecting your own mentor topic?<br><br>

<i><u>Accuracy</u></i><br>
Every sentence in the paper is logically true, or acceptable 
poetic license, or obvious hyperbole (for effect presumably)
or follows from something said in the presentation, or from 
some author's claim, which you have cited.  <br><br>

<i><u>Overall Grade</u></i><br>
In each category you will get an "A" if all the rubric items
are met.  You will get a "B" if most are met.  You will get 
a "C" if a good-faith effort shows.  You will get a "D" if something
is there beyond rubbish.  You will get an "F" if nothing is 
turned in or if what was turned in meets practically none of
the rubric's requirements.  The lowest category grade will 
count for 50% of the paper's grade.  The other two category 
grades will each count for 25% of the paper's grade.  (Note that it 
does not matter if the professor likes your paper or not.  It
matters that you logically explain and defend your responses to 
the three content prompts, and do so with style.)</blockquote> 

5.) This pattern will repeat for all the presentations, except 
that roles will be changed when our group does our presentation.
The discussion response paper for the "Fighting Fair" topic 
will be due on Tuesday, 11/21 along with the paper for the "Failure" 
topic.  The papers for the "Race", "Hospitality" and a
paper on our own "Thrifty" topic will all be due on Tuesday,
12/12.  Reduce your "dead-week" stress by keeping up with 
writing the related response papers shortly after each presentation
while your memory of the presentation is fresh.
<br><br>

6.) If you have not already done the "<u>optional assignment</u>" for
Thursday, November 9, consider doing it.  The deadline has 
been extended to November 16 at 12:25 PM (<a href="#MG11_option"

<b>Mentor Group 9 Meeting</b><br>
We will meet as our "Thrifty" group in room SB2732.<br><br>

<i>Before_Class_1031</i><br>
Group T8 will do the work of their T1 through T6 assignment.<br><br>

Groups T1 through T5:  Each group member must individually aggregate 
all relevant information (last week's "outcomes," outlines, sources,
etc.) and write a draft of the text needed to fill out your T-group's 
outline.  Your text should be between 900 and 1100 words long, not 
counting references.  Each student's work should encompass the entire
outline of your T-group's portion of the synopsis paper.  (These 
contributions will be edited into one whole on Thursday.)  <br><br>

Group T6:  Each group member must individually write text that will
fill out your assigned part of the outline for your "TED Talk"-style 
presentation. Your text should be between 900 and 1100 words long, not 
counting references.  (Your T-group's entire presentation will eventually 
need to be about 2500 words long.)  <br><br>

Group T7:  Each group member should individually write a final project 
proposal for the project you think is the most viable project.  Your 
finalized project should at least describe the activities needed to complete
the project and should also show when they will be done.  Also consider
any permissions that may be needed or rooms to be scheduled, equipment
to be borrowed, etc.  (In class on Thursday your group will merge all your
ideas down to one single project proposal.) Your group will be reporting back to 
class on your project's results on December 7, Mentor Reflection meeting 2.
Ideally, your project will be done before Thanksgiving break so that all
you have to do after thanksgiving is create a presentation for our "Thrifty"
group.  You may be asked to repeat the presentation for the entire 
CORE 399 class in the "big room." <br><br>

Library</a> by using electronic "databases" and search tools 
provided there and/or by visiting the library in person and/or
by discussing this assignment with a librarian as

sources</a>.  Generally these are journal articles,
books, or reputable magazines.  <i>These are generally
NOT web pages that can be accessed free and found via general 
Web search engines such as Bing, Google, Yahoo, etc.</i>  
Your sources must relate to 
your T-group assignment and they must be less than 10 years

confirm or add nuance to concepts you are already working with.
It will most likely be awkward if these sources address new 
topics not already included in your T-group's topic.  Later, 
in class, your T-group will rank and sort these sources and

Assignment for Thursday, October 12, <br>
<b>Discipleship Unit Class 8 meeting</b><br>
We will meet as our "Thrifty" group in room SB2732.<br>
See the assignment titled "How should we Live as Disciples in the 
Modern World?" This assignment is also described as the assignment "In Preparation for 
Discipleship Unit Class 8."  This assignment can be found in your 
<u>CORE 399 reader page 353</u>.<br> 
Write the requested one-page paper.  We will share these papers 
in small groups within our "Thrifty" group.  After class, you will turn your
paper in and it will be letter graded.  Required elements of the paper are:<br><br>

<i>Grammar and Style</i><br>
Conforms to either APA or MLA style (your choice)<br> 
Is single-spaced between lines<br>
Is double-spaced between paragraphs<br>
Uses a 10-point times-roman or similar font<br>
Is free of grammar and spelling errors<br>
It must fit on one side of one sheet of typing paper<br><br>


<i>Content</i><br>
Has a thesis in the first paragraph<br>
Usually a thesis is one, possibly two or three sentences<br>
The remainder of the paper supports the thesis or. . .<br>
discusses implications of alternative theses. <br>
Contains no off-thesis content.<br>
The thesis makes a connection between something in <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Maurer's 
book and something in our CORE 399 reader.  <br>
The thesis is developed by showing parallels or contrasts<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
or ties to still other sources such as the Bible, a <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
catechism, or any relevant source.<br><br>

<i>Accuracy</i><br>
Every sentence in the report is logically true, acceptable 
poetic license, or obvious hyperbole (for effect presumably)
or follows from some author's claim, which you have cited.  <br><br>

In each category you will get an "A" if all the rubric items
are met.  You will get a "B" if most are met.  You will get 
a "C" if a good-faith effort shows.  You will get a "D" something
is there beyond rubbish.  You will get an "F" if nothing is 
turned in or if what was turned in meets practically none of
the rubric's requirements.  The lowest category grade will 
count for 50% of the paper's grade.  The other two category 
grades will count for 25% of the paper's grade.  (Note that it 
does not matter if the professor likes your thesis or not.  It
matters that you logically explain and defend your thesis with 
style.)<br><br>

Note:  Prior to the above assignment, a different assignment is 
due on Tuesday, October 10.  That is the assignment for 
Discipleship Unit Class 7, found on page 297 of the reader.<br><br>
