<div class="title">Thank you!  Below is what you submitted to the Bookstore:</div>
<p><strong>EGR-322-01: Electronics I</strong></p>
<p>If new editions become available before classes start, would you like to use the new editions?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>If yes, are you aware if a new edition is currently available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p>Will the students enrolling in this course already have the textbook from a previous course that they themselves have taken?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Do you require a CD or access code, if one is available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will you be advising the students that they <strong>NEED</strong> to have their own textbook, that they may share a particular textbook, that they really don't need the textbook, or any other options you might share with the students?  <em>We would appreciate knowing this so that we can make a more responsible order decision on how many textbooks to order.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>
Some tests and the final exam in this course will be "open book." Each student will simultaneously need access to a textbook. Textbooks may not be shared during a test or during the final exam. Each student should personally bring a textbook to each class.  <br><br>

Electronic editions of the textbook will not be allowed for use on open book tests or on the final exam. </strong></p>

<p><b>TEXTBOOK'S WEB SITE</b><br>
FYI this textbook has an accompanying web site that will be useful to this course.  Several appendices to the textbook and other resources are hosted at the textbook's web site.  See <a href="http://www.sedrasmith.org">http://www.sedrasmith.org</a> <br><br>

<b>INTERNATIONAL EDITION NOT SUPPORTED</b><br>
International editions of the textbook will not be supported by the instructor.  Some book vendors are devious and will sell an international edition under the domestic ISBN number, although usually somewhere in the description of the product they admit that they are selling an "international edition."  International editions are cobbled together from older editions of the textbook and sold at a discount, often with the assurance that they are virtually interchangeable with the domestic edition.  They are not.  Also note that most paperback editions are international editions.  If the word "international" appears anywhere in the description or in photos describing the book, buyer beware.<br><br>

<b>ELECTRONIC EDITION NOT SUPPORTED</b><br>
Open book tests are not open computer or open Nook or open Kindle etc. tests.  Thus an electronic edition of the textbook will not be allowed at a test.   Students need a hardcopy version of the textbook.<br><br>

<b>NCEES-approved CALCULATOR REQUIRED</b><br>
Students may only use an NCEES approved calculator for tests and the final exam. The approved list can be found here: <a href="http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/">http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/</a>  Most students choose a TI-36X-Pro model.
