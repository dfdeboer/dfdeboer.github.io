<div class="title">Thank you!  Below is what you submitted to the Bookstore:</div>
<p><strong>MATH-204-02: Differential Equations</strong></p>
<p>If new editions become available before classes start, would you like to use the new editions?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>If yes, are you aware if a new edition is currently available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will the students enrolling in this course already have the textbook from a previous course that they themselves have taken?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Do you require a CD or access code, if one is available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will you be advising the students that they <strong>NEED</strong> to have their own textbook, that they may share a particular textbook, that they really don't need the textbook, or any other options you might share with the students?  <em>We would appreciate knowing this so that we can make a more responsible order decision on how many textbooks to order.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>
The instructor reserves the right to offer "open book" tests.  If a test is "open book" you will need to bring a hard-copy version of the textbook with you to the test.  Electronic versions of the textbook will not be allowed at an "open book" test.  If you can arrange it, you may bring a borrowed copy to the test, however, you must borrow it from a person not enrolled in your section of the course.  Textbooks may not be shared during a test.

<div class="header2"><b><u>Comments</u>:</b></div>
<p><b>INTERNATIONAL EDITION NOT SUPPORTED</b><br>
International editions of the textbook will not be supported by the instructor.  Some book vendors are devious and will sell an international edition under the domestic ISBN number, although usually somewhere in the description of the product they admit that they are selling an "international edition."  International editions are cobbled together from older editions of the textbook and sold at a discount, often with the assurance that they are virtually interchangeable with the domestic edition.  They are not.  Also note that most paperback editions are international editions.  If the word "international" appears anywhere in the description or in photos describing the book, buyer beware.<br><br>

<b>ELECTRONIC EDITION NOT SUPPORTED</b><br>
Open book tests are not open computer or open Nook or open Kindle etc. tests.  Thus an electronic edition of the textbook will not be allowed at a test.   Students need a hardcopy version of the textbook.<br><br>

<b>NCEES-approved CALCULATOR RECOMMENDED</b><br>
You may use your personal non-graphing calculator during tests if it is 
sufficiently not like a computer.  Specific models 
that will be allowed are specified by the NCEES here <a 
href="http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/">http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/</a>.  
From that list, most students choose a TI-36X-Pro model.  Any similar non-graphing 
calculator will be allowed, although one from the NCEES-approved list is 
recommended.  Here is a description of calculators that will NOT be allowed on 
tests:  A calculator built into your cell phone or wrist-watch will not be allowed.  
Any calculator with Wi-Fi capability or cell-tower connectivity or removable 
storarge (SD card, etc. even if it is under the battery door) or contains a 
QWERTY keyboard, microphone, camera, or speaker will not be allowed.  Some 
examples of calculator models that will not be allowed at tests are the
Ti-Nspire line of calculators, 
Ti-8x line, (Ti-82, Ti-84, etc.) 
Ti-9x line, 
Ti-Voyage line, 
Casio models that contain a "G" in the model number such as fx-9860-GII, 
Hewlett Packard models that have a "g" or "G" in the model number, (e.g. HP-49g+), 
HP-28S, 
HP-Prime.  
All these are NOT allowed on tests.
