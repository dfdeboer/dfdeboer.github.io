             INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOWNLOADING <br>

            FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH EGR 204   <br></td></tr>

<b>Downloading is NOT Required</b><br>
Quartus II is installed on most engineering lab computers.  It is  
quite practical to do all your Quartus II work on one of 
Dordt's computers.  It is not necessary for you to download it 
and install it on your personal computer, but Altera offers  
you permission to do so.                                </p><p>

<b>Quartus II is a big program</b><br>
Altera offers the "Web Edition" of Quartus II for free.  
You need a Windows 7, Vista, or XP computer with about 
4.5&nbsp;GB of free space on your hard drive. (That's quite a 
lot in comparison to most programs.)  The download itself is 
1.95&nbsp;GB.  It is not unusual for this download to take 
more than 5 minutes, sometimes hours more, even on a fast 
Internet connection.</p><p>

<b>The Web Edition is Full Featured</b><br>
The Web Edition it has all the features and capabilities of the 
Subscription Edition except that it does not support the newest 
and most powerful FPGA hardware, it cannot do incremental 
compilation, and access to Altera's "intellectual property" 
(pre-compiled designs) is limited.  These restrictions have 
no effect on the work assigned for this course.  For the 
purposes of this course, you would never be able to tell the 
difference between the Web Edition and the Subscription 
Edition.                                                </P><p>

<b>Use The Correct Version</b><br>
Quartus II Web Edition Version 9.1sp2 (Also known simply as 
version 9.1 or version 91) is recommended for this course 
and will be downloaded if you follow the instructions 
and links here.  The most recent release of Quartus II is 
version 12.&lt;something&gt; or higher.  The older version 
is best for work assigned in this course for three reasons.  
the latest version supports more hardware than we need. This 
consumes hard disk space for configuration files that we 
will never use. (About 12 GB vs 4.5 GB for Version 9.1sp2.
Considering the effect of this on backups in Dordt College's 
networked environment, this is a significant waste of 
storage space.)  Second, variations in menu structures and 
features make more recent versions difficult to use with the 
tutorials and lab handouts that we have.  Third, there are 
no compelling new features in version 12.1 that we could 
benefit from.   </p><p>

<b>Start Downloading</b><br>
If you have a campus network connection you can try 
downloading from Dordt's server.  Open "My Computer" and 
aim it at F:/classes/egr/304/Altera/91sp2_quartus_free.exe. 
Copy that file to your computer's desktop or some other
place on your local hard drive where you can easily find 
the copy.  This is much faster than using the Web, but 
generally only works on Dordt-owned computers on campus.  
Expect this download (the copy operation) to take about 
5 minutes.  Otherwise, download 91_quartus_free.exe 
directly from Altera's server.  Click on the Quartus II 
logo&mdash;the image above to get to Altera's download 
page.  Expect this download to take at least 15 minutes 
on a very fast connection, or maybe hours on a typcial 
connection subject to Internet network congestion.  
Once you have the intallation file on your computer, 
run the file.  The installation procedure is typical of 
any Windows program.                       </p><p>
