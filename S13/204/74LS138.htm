Perhaps you might find it interesting to know that the homework 
problems in the textbook can be done using realistic parts actually
available in the marketplace.  Figure 3.33 on Page 144 of our texbook 
shows the functional logic of a real part that is commercially for 
sale today.  One example is the TTL logic part with a part number 
in the '138 series.  </p><p>

However, the author of our textbook took out some double negations 
and made some other minor changes to make the logic easer to 
understand, compared to the actual commercially available part.  
You can view the actual schematic of real parts on 
any of a number of datasheets for these parts.  For example, in 
<a href="http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheets/90/232315_DS.pdf"
>Fairchild's datasheet</a>, see the lower left quadrant of page 2.  In 
this datasheet you can see that each input to the part goes to only 
one logic gate.  The non-inverted inputs are derived from the 
inverted inputs by another set of inverters.  This reduces the 
amount of current that flows through each input pin, but it has no 
effect on the logical outcome.  </p><p>

The author of our textbook choose 
to ignore this detail and removed the extra inverters from his 
schematic.  If built as shown in our textbook however, the decoder
would cause more heating of the chips connected to it because of 
the increased current flow through it's input pins.  You can use 
either schematic since logically they are equivalent.  (Use our 
textbook's because it is simpler!)</p><p>

Since the '138 part has "negative true outputs" (all outputs are
logic-1 except the single output that is addressed&mdash;see the 
"function table" in the datasheet linked above) you will need
to use a NAND gate to functionally OR a set of minterms together.
This is the case because a logic-0 on any input to a NAND gate 
will force the output of the gate to go to logic-1.
