<div class="title">Thank you!  Below is what you submitted to the Bookstore:</div>
<p><strong>EGR-204-01: Intro:Microprocessors</strong></p>
<p>If new editions become available before classes start, would you like to use the new editions?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>If yes, are you aware if a new edition is currently available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will the students enrolling in this course already have the textbook from a previous course that they themselves have taken?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Do you require a CD or access code, if one is available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will you be advising the students that they <strong>NEED</strong> to have their own textbook, that they may share a particular textbook, that they really don't need the textbook, or any other options you might share with the students?  <em>We would appreciate knowing this so that we can make a more responsible order decision on how many textbooks to order.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Each student should have his or her own textbook. This course will be peer graded and will have homework assignment practically every class period. For this reason, timely access to the textbook during class and between classes is important. Sharing a textbook will not be practical. One textbook is required for each student in EGR 204.</strong></p>

<p>International versions of this textbook are not the same as the domestic version, even if the edition numbers and cover art match. 

A few unscrupulous booksellers have put the domestic ISBN and barcode on a sticky address label (e.g. Avery brand or similar) and plastered that over the book's real ISBN number and sold the book to people searching on the Web for the domestic ISBN. Their description includes the word "international." These books are made from copied pages from various older editions.  Page numbers will not match, homework problems will not match, information will be out-of-date, and there will be more errata than in the domestic edition. Book vendors sometimes "guarantee" that the international version is sufficiently similar to the domestic version. At least in the case of this textbook this is absolutely not the case.  What do you think--will a vendor who is willing to change the ISBN number actually care about equivalency and actually honor a "guarantee?" 

Once these books get into the US market they might keep circulating. They get sold as used books to reputable booksellers because the (plastered on) barcode of the ISBN and the cover art match the domestic version. International versions have the word "international" on the title page (one of the front pages, not necessarily on the cover) which still allows easy identification of an international version. If one of these books slips through the system into your hands, a reputable bookseller (who did not describe it as an "international" edition) will promptly exchange the book. Still, time and shipping expense gets wasted. 

Kind of a long explanation huh!? In this course (only this course) it has been a problem for about two students per semester who have ordered their textbook via the Web. The Dordt College Bookstore has an advantage in quality of service. They check their books before they go into inventory. If anything does go wrong they will make amends as promptly as possible and take the hassle out of dealing with postage, etc.
********************************

The departmental policy of requiring an NCEES approved calculator does not apply to this course.  In fact, no calculator is needed for this course.  No calculators are allowed on the tests or final exam for this course. All the homework can be done conveniently without a calculator, assuming you remember how to do arithmetic with pencil and paper.  Most of it is as easy as 2 x 2 = 4.  In a very few instances you might want to use a calculator for homework.  Practically any calculator will do for that optional use.</p>
