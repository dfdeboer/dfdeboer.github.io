<div class="title">Thank you!  Below is what you submitted to the Bookstore:</div>
<p><strong>EGR-323-01: Electronics II</strong></p>
<p>If new editions become available before classes start, would you like to use the new editions?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>If yes, are you aware if a new edition is currently available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will the students enrolling in this course already have the textbook from a previous course that they themselves have taken?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px;">If so, from which course? <strong>EGR 322, Fall 2012</strong></p>
<p>Do you require a CD or access code, if one is available?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>Will you be advising the students that they <strong>NEED</strong> to have their own textbook, that they may share a particular textbook, that they really don't need the textbook, or any other options you might share with the students?  <em>We would appreciate knowing this so that we can make a more responsible order decision on how many textbooks to order.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>The textbook is required for all students in EGR 323. Each student in EGR 323 should have his or her own textbook. This is a discussion-oriented class. For this reason, timely access to the textbook in class is important.</strong></p>

<p>NEW AS OF AUGUST 2012:

Although any calculator will be allowed for tests and exams in this course, students are encouraged to use an NCEES approved calculator. The approved list can be found here: http://www.ncees.org/Exams/Exam-day_policies/Calculator_policy.php

THE SAME AS THE LAST OFFERING OF THIS COURSE:
A new texbook include
s a DVD. In a used textbook the DVD is not required but is desireable as a convenience. Contents of the DVD: ***** Cadence PSpice v16.2 Demo Software. A newer version is avalable free as "OrCAD PCB Designer Lite" also known as "OrCAD 16.5 Demo Software (Capture and PSpice only)" at http://www.cadence.com/products/orcad/pspice_simulation/pages/default.aspx 
***** National Instruments Multisim v10.1.1 Student Edition 
***** Lab-on-a-disk SPICE Simulations (also available on courses @ dordt) 
***** Bonus Text Topics (also available on courses@dordt) 
***** Text Appendicies (also available on courses@dordt) 
***** Link to Sedra/Smith Website (also available on courses@dordt). The one item on the DVD not available without the DVD and the textbook is the NI "Multisim Student Edition." However the Multisim software is not used at Dordt (we use the PSpice software) and the NI "Multisim Education Edition" 30-day trial is available free on the web at http://www.ni.com/multisim/try/ . The version included on the DVD with the textbook requires Windows Vista, Windows XP, or Windows 2000 SP3 or later, 32 bit versions only. Specifically, Multisim Student Edition 10.1 (on the DVD) is not specficially supported on Windows 7. (For access to the content on courses@dordt you must be enrolled in the course.)</p>
