This is a thirteen-track abslolute posistion grey-code encoder. <br>
Thirteen bits of code gives resolution of (360 degrees)/(2<sup>13</sup>) = 0.044 degrees.<br>
It is no wonder that the camera used to take this photograph did not have enough<br>
resolution to accurately represent the outer two tracks.<br>
<br>
The zero position (code in binary is "0 0000 0000 0000") is between "noon" and 1 o'clock. (The dark "V" shape pointing outward.)<br>
The "1 1111 1111 1111" code is between 8 and 9 o'clock. (Why not right next to the "0 0000 0000 0000" code?)<br>
There is some damage to the track from disassembling the product.  The damage is near the bottom of the image.  
<br>
<br>This image is 1135 by 1124 pixels.  For a clear view you need to view it at full resolution.<br>
Full resolution means the outer diameter of the body of this encoder is shown as about 9 or 10 inches across on most desktop and laptop screens.<br>
If your screen is not large enough to show a full 9 or 10 inches of diameter, zoom in and pan the image to view part of it at full resoluiton.<br>
