<A Name = "Introduction"></A>
<H1>Introduction</H1> 

<P>The Dordt College Library has an excellent set of web pages 
called <A HREF = 
"https://denis.dordt.edu/academics/library/static/Searchpath/choosemodules.html">Searchpath</A>  
which give a good overview of the types of topics addressed on 
this web page in great detail.  If you have not seen Dordt's 
<A HREF = 
"https://denis.dordt.edu/academics/library/static/Searchpath/choosemodules.html">Searchpath</A> 
you should read that before proceeding. </P>

<P>This page is here to help my students find literature and 
decide what sources to rely on when they are writing papers for 
me.  Below I describe two ways of classifying sources.  Then I 
discuss how to search the literature.  Finally I list and 
classify a number of periodical sources that I want my students 
to be aware of.  </P>


<A Name = "Primary"></A>
<A HREF = "#Outline">[top]</A><H1>
Primary, Secondary, and Other Sources</H1>

<P>A source can be classified according to how close the source 
is to original information.  </P> 

<P>In Engineering, a <B>primary source</b> is the first 
publication of a theory, observation, or other idea.  Most 
articles in professional journals, official government reports, 
data in data manuals, and published standards are primary 
sources.  (For example, all the IEEE Transactions are primary 
sources.)  A primary source does not have to be in print.  It 
could be a film, a speech, or a web page.  In any case, it is the 
original or first publication of the idea.</P> 

<P>The bibliography of a primary source often gives a rather 
complete history of the background to the idea.  This in itself 
can be valuable. </P> 

<P> <B>Secondary</B> sources give wider distribution to the ideas 
contained in primary sources.  These may be explanations aimed at 
a non-technical audience, interviews, reviews or digests of 
primary sources, tutorials, etc.  Most textbooks, articles in 
newspapers, and magazines (<I>Circuit Cellar</I>, 
<I>Newsweek</I>, etc.) are secondary sources when it comes to 
engineering information.  The <I>Proceedings of the IEEE</I> is 
an example of a secondary source.  It is a journal of tutorials 
and historical reviews on topics of recent interest in the 
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).</P> 


<P>Secondary sources can be good places to look for ideas for a 
thesis.  These sources often have greater breadth of coverage 
than any individual primary source.  The bibliography of a 
secondary source can lead you to other related primary and 
secondary sources that may be of value to you. </P> 

<P><B>Tertiary</B> or <B>other sources</B>, are sources such as 
student papers, and book reviews that do not present original 
ideas and do not make reference to primary sources.  (Notice how 
the definition is cast in the negative--" . . .do not make reference to 
primary sources.")</P> 

</P>Many high-school papers are themselves tertiary sources.  
Lately some classes require students to post papers on the web.  
Yahoo, Alta-Vista and so forth will find them (and probably not 
tell you the author is a student!).  Your paper will be more 
authoritative if you rely more heavily on primary and secondary 
sources rather than tertiary sources.  You should not neglect any 
primary sources you run across, and when using a secondary 
source, look into the primary sources it refers to if you can. 
</P> 

<P>The main point is that the further you are from a primary 
source, the more one can question the veracity of the 
information.</P> 



<A Name = "Peer"></A>
<A HREF = "#Outline">[top]</A><H1>
Peer Reviewed, Trade, Popular, and Individual Publications </H1> 

<P>Literature that has been reviewed by members of a professional 
society, government organization, or other accepted authority is 
said to be <B>peer reviewed</B>.  Peer review is a quality 
control process for published literature.  A hallmark of peer 
review is the care usually taken to avoid bias and act neutrally.  
However, the neutrality of the reviewer usually may be critically 
appraised.  For example, if the peer review is provided by a 
commercial enterprise or public interest group there may be 
rather obvious reasons why the organization would publish a 
certain author's work.  Even in highly technical situations, for 
example an IEEE publication on a new coding method for data 
compression, the interests of the professional society filter 
what gets published and that represents a non-neutral act.  In 
spite of any such critical appraisal of the review process, peer 
review assures that the work published is at least representative 
of a recognized segment of society.</P> 

<P>Publications by commercial companies for profit and for the 
benefit of practitioners in the field are called <B>trade</B> 
literature.  This literature usually assumes the reader has a 
certain prerequisite amount of knowledge about the discipline.  
If the literature were reviewed by an independent body it would 
become peer reviewed literature, but instead it has been reviewed 
by an editor or a group who has a profitable interest in the 
publication of the work.  Usually the demands of the professional 
audience enforce a certain quality in the editing of these 
periodicals, but the quality does vary between publications. 
<I>IEEE Spectrum</I>, <I>Circuit Cellar</I>, and <I>Power 
Engineering</I> are examples of trade publications.  </P> 

<P><B>Popular</B> publications are those written for a general 
audience or for hobbyists.  Most newspapers and magazines sold on 
news stands fit this category.  Some examples are <I>The Wall 
Street Journal</I>, <I>Time Magazine</I>, <I>Scientific 
American</I>, and <I>Poptronics</I>.  The editors of these 
publications are the primary insurance of quality since the 
audience is assumed to be non-specialized.  Some editors do a 
better job than others.  (Or-- some editors do a rotten job.)  In 
the field of electronics, one must be careful with these 
magazines.  There are some articles with many errors in the 
details of the schematics, parts numbers, and so forth.  
Standards are sometimes compromised or skirted in order to 
simplify the circuitry, often without informing the reader of the 
short-cuts made.  Sometimes explanations of how a circuit works 
are based on simplified theories--theories not suitable for a 
college-level paper.  Some editors have even gone so far as to 
publish construction projects that have never been built, 
simulated, or tested!  On the other hand, these magazines can 
stimulate your imagination and lead you to good project ideas. 
Besides which, they are fun to read.</P> 

<P>Sometimes it is hard to tell if a periodical is a trade or a 
popular publication.  For example <I>Byte</I> magazine started as 
a popular publication for hobbyists, but evolved into a trade 
magazine.  It is hard to say just when the change occurred.  The 
issues from the mid 1980's through the mid 1990's could be 
classified either way.  You could also make a case that 
<I>Circuit Cellar</I> is intended for hobbyists, not engineers, 
and thus is a popular rather than a trade publication.  The exact 
category is not so important.  A good assessment of the quality 
of the editing is more valuable. </P> 

<P><B>Individual</B> publications are those written by one person 
or a small organization.  The distinctive feature is that they 
have little or no editorial oversight.  Anything goes.  
Individual publications may or may not be addressed to a general 
audience.  In particular, the intended audience of many 
individually published web pages is intended to be a specific 
group--maybe not you.  For example this web page is intended for 
students of Professor De Boer. I recommend that if you use such a 
source, you also provide a parallel and more authoritative 
source, or justify the authority of the author(s) for your 
situation.</P> 

<P>This web page itself is an example of an individual 
publication--tertiary no less.  (There are no original ideas 
here, and I'm not drawing on a primary source.)  If you are not 
my student, you are advised that your professor might not agree 
with the ideas I present here.</P> 

<P>However the source is classified, you must assess the 
reliability of the source.  It is possible that an individually 
published tertiary source (on the web for example--like this 
page!) is very valuable to you.  Maybe the author is quite 
authoritative on the subject.  It is also possible for a peer 
reviewed primary source to be full of wrong or obsolete ideas.  
However, these are not the most likely scenarios.  In unusual 
cases it would be well for you to point out the authority of your 
author or, in the opposite type of situation, to show by means of 
other sources why an article in a peer reviewed and otherwise 
trustworthy source is wrong.</P> 

<P>The vast majority of quality literature is only available for 
a fee.  Usually, you get what you pay for (or your college pays 
for).  There are some exceptions.  For example, government 
reports are paid for with taxes and are therefore usually 
available free on the web or for a nominal fee via the mail.  
Another exception is the case where the information is mostly 
useless unless one has certain hardware.  A specification sheet 
for an integrated circuit is an example.  In spite of the large 
amount of quality literature available on the web (from 
government sources, data sheets, etc.) it would be fair to say 
that <B>most</B> of the information available for free on the 
World Wide Web is of little value for the research papers I 
assign.  This is because most of it is individually published 
secondary or tertiary material.  Consider the web to be only one 
of several vehicles for the distribution of information.  Do not 
discount the value of paid-for paperbound journals, books in the 
library, and microfilm, just because you cannot get to them by 
clicking your mouse.  Keep in mind that your professors are the 
ones who order the literature in your library--and they do so to 
support the assignments they give.  Click your mouse on the 
web--where your professors have little idea of what you will 
find--only after you know what is available locally.</P> 



<A Name = "People"></A>
<A HREF = "#Outline">[top]</A><H1>
The People Behind the Papers</H1> 

<P>Some periodicals invite certain experts to write papers for 
them.  If the paper is <B>invited</B> that constitutes an 
endorsement of the authority of the author(s) by the editor of 
the journal.  Sometimes this type of endorsement can go layers 
deep.  The journal's editor might select a <B>guest editor</B> 
(even more authoritatively, a team of guest editors) to organize 
a theme section or issue.  Then the guest editor(s) usually write 
some of the papers and invite others to assist them to write more 
papers.  If the journal is peer reviewed, then all the papers are 
reviewed by experts other than the authors and editors.  Usually 
the journal will note which papers are invited.  An example of a 
journal that publishes mostly invited papers is the 
<I>Proceedings of the IEEE</I>.</P> 

<P>Some periodicals (especially trade and popular periodicals) 
hire people to write for them on a full or part-time basis.  
These people have titles such as <B>Contributing Editor</B> or 
<B>Staff Writer</B>.  You can notice these by looking at the 
periodical's <B>Masthead</B>.  The masthead is usually a box of 
small print on one of the first few pages of the periodical that 
describes the ownership of the periodical and lists the names of 
the editors and others who oversee the content of the periodical.  
If your article has no author shown, then it was probably written 
by a contributing editor, etc.  That is commonly the case for 
short articles that are amalgamations from a variety of sources 
such as "New Product Announcements," or "News Digest."  Sometimes 
contributing editors write entire feature articles.  Usually they 
are then listed as the author(s) of the article.  If an author of 
your article is listed in the masthead, then the author is a 
contributing editor or staff writer, etc.  These authors usually 
publish exclusively and frequently in that one periodical.  It is 
possible to assess the quality of one of these author's works in 
the context of the entire body of the author's works.  For 
example, Fred Eady is a contributing editor for <I>Circuit 
Cellar</I> magazine.  He usually writes on the topic of embedded 
microcontrollers.  If I suddenly saw an article by him in another 
periodical, or on a very different topic (say power systems) then 
I would look twice to assess why this happened.  If I have seen 
good articles by him in the past, then I am more likely to 
respect his writing in the future.</P>

<P>Other papers in periodicals are offered to the periodical by 
the author(s) without an invitation.  The author simply has an 
idea to share with the world.  These are called <B>submitted</B> 
papers.  Some periodicals accept all submitted papers.  More 
commonly, they accept submitted papers after a recommendation via 
an editor or a peer review process.  Some periodicals never 
accept submitted papers.  Sometimes the author of a submitted 
paper gets paid a small amount--usually the case for popular and 
trade publications.  Conversely, sometimes the author must pay 
page charges (usually about $100 per page) to get a paper 
published--usually the case for a peer reviewed journal. </P> 




<A Name = "Searching"></A>
<A HREF = "#Outline">[top]</A><H1>
Searching the Literature</H1> 

<P>I presume you have some idea of your topic.  For example, 
suppose you have been assigned to write a research paper about 
the operation or regulation of an electric utility company.  That 
is a very broad area to start searching.  It would be best to 
review some of the periodicals dedicated to power systems 
engineering.  The <I>EPRI Journal</I> is such an example.  In a 
case like this it is more productive to thumb through about a 
years worth of the <I>Journal</I> to see what the feature 
articles are about.  Then you can start making some theses 
statements to see how they work out.  </P> 

<P>Suppose you try the thesis, "Low reserves of electric power 
generation during the summers in the late 1990's gave politicians 
a clear prediction of the rolling blackouts California now 
suffers."  Now there is some focus for your further research.  
Think of questions that could support or disprove your proposed 
thesis and see where they lead.  For example, were there 
blackouts caused by insufficient reserves in the 1990's?  (yes--
in Chicago)  What did the politicians do about that?  (new laws 
and regulations)  Are the conditions in California similar to 
those existing in Chicago?  (No--oops, the thesis needs to be 
changed or refined. . .)  Once you have specific questions on 
specific topics then some of the more specific search engines can 
help. </P> 

<P>Popular web search engines such as Alta-Vista, Google, and 
Yahoo might get you started (that is--they might), but they <B>do 
not cover the <U>vast majority</U> of the published 
literature</B>--only the static and non-password protected 
contents of the web.  If that is where all the good 
information was, that would be fine, but for the papers I 
assign, these popular search engines will not be very productive.  
If you want a broad and general overview, an encyclopedia might 
be a better starting point.  There are a number of them in 
Dordt's library.  Some are on paper, some are in electronic form.  
Paper has the advantage when it comes to browsing.  It simply 
takes too long to scroll through screens of information on a 
computer.  On the other hand, if you have some good keywords to 
search for, then the electronic versions (of the encyclopedias, 
not Yahoo etc.)  tend to be better.  But woe to the student who 
can't think up the best keywords.  Then it were far better that 
she or he were cast into a pile of print version Encyclopedia 
Britanicas for an hour!  The keywords themselves come from the 
literature.  It is not likely you will be able to just think them 
up cold. </P> 

<P>Where to look then if not on the web via Google?  Look at 
where the books and journals most likely to be helpful are 
indexed.  In other words, first select your library.  I mean that 
figuratively--select a set of literature--not literally something 
like "Dordt's Library."  (Example: on the topic of the operation 
or regulation of an electric utility company, you could select 
related books found in Dordt's library and the Sioux Center 
Public Library, the <I>EPRI Journal</I>, and <I>Power 
Engineering</I> Magazine as an initial start for "your library.") 
Then search through that library's index(es).  That will find 
books, video tapes, and other media on the shelves in a building 
and available electronically.  When you find a book, browse the 
shelves (or call numbers) nearby because the books are filed in 
order by topic. </P>

<P>Usually it is best to look for books before looking for 
periodicals.  Books usually cover the subject with greater 
breadth.  They will give you ideas for subject searches and 
keywords, and the bibliographies in them can lead you to other 
sources.  You are not going to read all of these books--scan them 
and read relevant portions.  Be sure to scan the preface, table 
of contents and introduction of each book.  They were written for 
people in your situation--people who need to find information and 
can't spend time reading everything. </P> 

<P>To find the periodical literature, select some available 
periodicals. then <B>browse through them</B> to become familiar 
with the type of content typically in each periodical.  Create a 
list of periodicals that are relevant to your topic.  Then search 
these with some intensity.  Becoming familiar with the literature 
is one of the reasons I assign papers.  It will help you in your 
career or in graduate school.  After graduation, periodicals will 
become the most frequent type of technical literature you will 
use. </P> 

<P>Look at the table of contents of several issues of a 
particular periodical.  Some are organized by themes.  For 
example almost every issue of the <I>Proceedings of the IEEE</I> 
concentrates on a theme.  The January 2001 issue was on the theme 
of "Multidimensional Broadband Wireless Technologies and 
Services."  The February 2001 issue was on "Agents in Modeling 
and Simulation. . ."  Or, in some cases there are certain themes 
or columns that recur periodically.  For example every fourth 
issue of <I>Circuit Cellar</I> has a theme section on "Embedded 
Applications."  If you have the paper copy in front of you, look 
at the spine.  Often the featured themes are right there--you 
don't even have to take the periodical off the shelf to see the 
theme.  If your periodical is on microfilm, look at the cover.  
Usually the themes are there.  Understanding these patterns can 
more quickly direct you toward more relevant sources and away 
from useless ones. </P> 

<P>If the periodical is only available to you electronically in a 
"full-text" database then you can't look at the spine to read the 
theme of the issue.  Also, the cover might have been omitted from the 
database, and you might not have access to the publisher's 
masthead, or  the original table of contents.  Some graphics and 
equations may have been omitted.  (That is, no whole issues are 
available, just the text from the articles.)  Sometimes you can 
assemble a table of contents for an issue by limiting the search 
to a particular journal and a range of dates that covers only one 
issue. (e.g. January 1 through January 31 would pick out the 
January issue of a monthly).  Then leave the "search for" box 
blank and click the search button.  The list that results might 
be able to substitute for a table of contents. </P> 

<P>Hopefully your browsing will turn up at least one or two 
articles that are related to your topic.  Look through those 
articles for keywords, subjects, and related subjects.  Then do 
subject or keyword searches, but limit the search just to that 
journal or a few journals.   These more focused searches will 
still probably bring up some (maybe 10?) irrelevant references 
for every good one, but searching the whole world at once will 
surely bury the good sources like a needle in a haystack.  Is 
your search now showing the most likely 20 of 384,721 possible 
matches?  Forget it!  Do a more restricted search. </P> 

<P>An effective literature search must employ several techniques 
to find sources.  Web searches alone (like Alta-Vista and Yahoo) 
are not enough.  Electronic searches through on-line databases 
alone are not enough.  Browsing alone is not enough.  You have to 
read some of the material as you find it too.  That way you 
discover additional keywords and subjects.  If you have found a 
valuable article or book, do some author searches (for books, 
articles in periodicals, and web sites) to see what else that 
person has published.   Find out the subjects under which those 
articles are classified and do subject searches to find out what 
that person's colleagues have published.  Each search method 
generates grist for each other method.  </P> 



<A Name = "Indices"></A>
<A HREF = "#Outline">[top]</A><H1>
Recommended Indices</H1>

<P>Every index has certain strengths.  Below I have listed the 
indices which will be most productive for the types of papers I 
assign.</P> 

<H2>Computers & Applied Sciences Complete</H2>
Of all the indexing services available at Dordt College for 
engineering subjects, this one is the easiest to use.  You can 
find a link to it on the <A 
HREF="http://denis.dordt.edu/offices/library/">via the home-page 
of Dordt's Library</A>.  It is also one of the most extensive.  
Virtually <i>all</i> the peer reviewed journals and periodicals 
in the subject of electrical engineering are indexed here.  In 
most cases you cannot get the full text of articles found 
from this index.  If the article is reported to be available in 
the library you should ask a librarian for help finding it unless 
you are already familiar with finding journal articles.  If the 
library does not have the article you may use Dordt's 
interlibrary loan service.  Again, ask a librarian for help on 
how to do this.

microfilm records are not extensive enough to include the 
particular article you might be seeking.  In that case, you may 
use Dordt's interlibrary loan service.  Again, ask a librarian 
for help on how to do this.  -->

<!-- <H2>Ingenta</H2>

<P>most publications in electrical engineering are 
indexed in Ingenta's "Journal or book title" service.  It is 
strong in depth of coverage. </P> 

</P>Ingenta is a British company and the satellite links to their 
web pages may be slow here in the USA.  It is worth the wait.  
Ingenta has two sides to it, the "Online Articles" and 
"fax/ariel" service.  "Fax/ariel" includes scientific, 
engineering, and technology literature, most of which is not in 
the "Online Articles" section.  "Fax/ariel" is where you will 
find the indexing services mentioned on this page.  To get at 
publications listed below, always click "fax/ariel" if that 
option is given.  Note that you can browse this database by 
periodical title, and get tables of contents.  (Look for the 
"browse publications" link.)  

<P>Ingenta does not always include all the content of each 
journal issue.  Book Reviews, editorials, and similar content may 
be omitted.  I am recommending Ingenta for browsing tables of 
contents to find feature articles (it works better than Ebscohost 
for that) and for searching when the journal is not in Ebscohost.  
(Ebscohost seems to search more effectively--if the journal of 
interest is in Ebscohost).  Ingenta is NOT a good source for 
full-text access for you--Dordt has other options available.  If 
Ingenta suggests that you purchase the full-text with a credit 
card, talk to a librarian or your professor to find a better 
deal.  (First make sure it is not on the Dordt College Library's 
shelves, Ebscohost, or the publisher's web site!) Ingenta is 
available to the public at <A HREF = 
"http://www.ingentaconnect.com">http://www.ingentaconnect.com</A>.</P> 
-->

<H2>IEEE Xplore</H2>

<P>IEEE publishes thirty percent of the world's technical 
literature in electrical engineering, computer science and 
electronics and the <A HREF = 
"http://www.ieee.org/web/publications/subscriptions/patentcitation/index.html">top-cited 
journals</A> in electrical engineering, telecommunications, 
computer theory and methods. IEEE Xplore is the IEEE's full-text 
access to IEEE transactions, journals, magazines and conference 
proceedings published since 1988 plus select content back to 
1950, and all current IEEE Standards.  (copied from IEEE web 
pages.)  </P> 

<P>IEEE Xplore is important since it indexes most of the top 
journals and some of the top magazines in the field of electrical 
engineering.  Recently it added the <A 
HREF="http://www.theiet.org/">IET</A>'s publications to the 
database.  (The IET is the British counterpart to the IEEE).  
</P> 

<P>FREE TO ALL:  Ability to browse tables of contents of all IEEE 
transactions, journals, magazines, conference proceedings and 
standards.  (All the links in the left-hand frame above the word 
"Search" work for all users, members or not.)
</P> 

<P>IEEE STUDENT MEMBERS:  You can search and access all IEEE 
abstract/citation records from all IEEE journals, conference 
proceedings and standards.  You may also access your full-text 
online personal subscriptions (known as OPeRA) here.  You will 
need an <A 
HREF="http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=corp_level1&path=web/accounts&file=index.xml&xsl=generic.xsl">IEEE 
web account</A>, which is free to student members. </P>

<P>If you are a Dordt College student you may <A 
HREF="http://homepages.dordt.edu/ieeesb/index_join.html">become a 
student member</A> rather economically.  Before completing the 
membership application it would be best to talk to a local 
student member of the <A HREF 
="http://homepages.dordt.edu/ieeesb/">IEEE Dordt College Student 
Branch</A> to get advise on how to maximize the benefits you 
subscribe to at minimum cost (possibly zero cost after rebates). 
</P> 

<P>IEEE Xplore is available at <A HREF = 
"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org</A>. </P>

<H2>Ebscohost</H2>
        
<P>Our library's primary indexing service for periodical 
literature is Ebscohost's "Academic Search Premier" database, 
available from the <A HREF 
="http://denis.dordt.edu/offices/library/">Dordt library's web 
page</A>.  Ebscohost is an excellent service for our campus as a 
whole.  You should be aware however that most of the prestigious 
engineering periodicals are not indexed in Ebscohost.  (The part 
of Ebscohost subscribed to by Dordt that is.)  On the other hand 
there are literally hundreds of trade and popular periodicals 
with engineering content indexed in Ebscohost.  It is strong in 
breadth.  </P> 


<P>Besides indexing, abstracts and full text are often also 
available from Ebscohost.  Ebscohost's indexing and abstracting 
service often only goes back to about 1996 (for the periodicals 
listed below).  You can check in Ebscohost to see how far back 
each periodical is indexed and abstracted.  The Ebscohost 
database will also tell you where you can find the article.  If 
the "Note: This title IS available in the Dordt Library" line 
shows, then you will find the article on the shelves either in 
the "Current Journals" area, or in the "Bound Journals" area.  
Ask a librarian if you cannot find these areas.  If the "full-
text" icon shows, then you can get the full text from the 
Ebscohost database.</P> 

In Ebscohost's "Academic Search Premier" Database, you can get 
information about a journal if you know a few words in the title.  
On the top menu bar, click on "Publications."  Then enter a key 
word and click on the "Match Any Words" button before clicking 
"browse" to start the search.  For example, let's find out if 
the magazine "Electrical World" is peer reviewed.  Enter 
"Electrical World" in the box, click the "Match Any Words" 
button, click "Browse," and Electrical World pops up, in this 
case right on top of the list.  Click on the title and you get 
SOME of the information about the publication.  Then click on 
"Publication Details" and you get all the information.  This one 
is not peer reviewed.  Try again with "IEEE Power" as key words 
in the publication title, then click on "IEEE Transactions on 
Power Delivery," etc. and you will see that this one is peer 
reviewed.  You can also find out if the publisher has a web site.  
Sometimes the web sites contain supplemental articles.  

<H2>Other Indices</H2>

<P>If you need an older article (not in the databases) for a 
paper I've assigned, talk to me or a librarian about it and we 
will look into other ways to find it besides those described 
here. </P>

Recommended Periodicals</H1>

<P>Below I have listed periodicals I am aware of that are 
accessible to my students and that may be relevant to papers I 
assign.  Of course the periodicals mentioned below are not the 
"vast majority of the literature."  Instead, I expect they will 
be a productive and available subset of that "vast majority."  If 
you have personal subscriptions or access to another library, 
then you may find still more sources.  If nothing much is stated 
about a particular publication, it is available either via 
Ebscohost or in the Dordt College Library.  Most of these are 
indexed in the Applied Science and Technology index or in 
Ebscohost.  The titles listed here are listed because Professor 
De Boer endorses them.  </P> 

<P>You do not have to restrict your research to these endorsed 
periodicals.  It is just that Professor De Boer thinks you should 
at least be aware of the publications below to see if any of 
them fit your area of interest.</P>

Government Reports </I></B> <DIR>
    <P>Official government reports are peer reviewed literature.  
    An official government report will always include 
    information in the front pages which explains the origin 
    of the report, how to get additional copies of the report, 
    and any contracts that relate to the report.  In order to be 
    an official government report (and thus peer reviewed) there 
    must be a claim of government sponsorship.  Look for 
    something like, "This report was prepared as an account of 
    work sponsored by an agency of the United States Government."  
    (In contrast, ordinary web pages are not official reports--
    therefore not peer reviewed--even though the URL ends with 
    ".gov".) </P>

    <P>If you know you are after a government document but do not 
    know how to search for it, you can start with the Dordt 
    college library's web page of Online Reference Links, the <A 
    HREF = 
    "http://denis.dordt.edu/offices/library/libref.shtml#govsources"> 
    Governmental Resources</A> section.  Note that <A HREF = 
    "http://www.firstgov.com">FirstGov.com</A> is a good place to 
    start looking for federal government documents.  For example, 
    if you are looking for Bush's National Energy Policy, a 
    search for <A HREF = 
    "http://firstgovsearch.gov/search?v%3Aproject=firstgov&query=National+Energy+Policy">"National 
    Energy Policy" on FirstGov.com</A> brings up several copies 
    of the the document including one <A HREF = 
    "http://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/">hosted by the 
    whitehouse</A>.  </P> 
    
    <P>If you still can't find what you are looking for on your 
    own, ask for help.</P> </DIR>

<BR><B><I>
Standards </I></B> <BR> <DIR>
    <p>Does one of your sources make some claim against a 
    standard?  E.g. "USB allows hot-plugging" whatever that is!  
    Then go get the standard and find out.  Go directly to the 
    primary source if you can.  Our library has some standards on 
    the shelf.  Use Dordt's Webcat to find these.  (USB is one 
    standard we have.)  Some more are available via ftp or the 
    web.  A Google or Yahoo type search might find those or 
    give you a lead to where to find it.  If you know who 
    sponsors the standard, check their web site.</P>

    <P>Technically, a "draft standard" is not (yet) a peer 
    reviewed document.  Professor De Boer might accept it as peer 
    reviewed anyway--talk to him about it and see if he 
    approves.</P>

    from this journal, see Prof. De Boer before ordering. <BR> 
    <BR> 

    Circuit Cellar calls itself "The magazine for computer 
    applications."  Most of the content has to do with 
    construction projects that involve interfacing hardware to a 
    PC, microprocessor, or microcontroller.  It is a good source 
    for project ideas.  <B>Steve Ciarcia</B> started "Circuit 
    Cellar" as a column in Byte back when he was a technical 
    editor for the magazine.  In January 1988 he spun the 
    "Circuit Cellar" column out into its own magazine (although 
    his column continued to run in Byte through 1988.)  He has 
    also published some books of electronics projects with the 
    words "Circuit Cellar" in the title. <BR><BR>

    The <A HREF = "http://www.circuitcellar.com/">magazine's web 
    site</A> supports the published articles with source code for 
    programs discussed in the articles.  This site also contains 
    many links to a related electronic publication that has 
    different content.  See "Circuit Cellar Online" below.  
    Clicking on one of these links will take you away from the 
    content related to the print magazine.  There is also a 
    "Digital Library."  The content of the digital library comes 
    from several sources, but generally does not include the 
    articles in the print edition.  <BR><BR>

    key words.  A few of the articles are available online from 
    links in this table of contents.  Note that the first page of 
    an online article usually contains a link to "Sources & PDF."  
    The PDF version of the article is formatted the same as the

    "The magazine was started by editors who had left <I>Life</I> 
    magazine fired with the conviction that history belongs to 
    the people and not just to scholars, and that pictures are a 
    vital part of it.  Throughout its career, American Heritage 
    has used a blend of lively, authoritative prose and wide-
    ranging illustrations--archival photos, rarely seen 
    paintings, a wealth of materials old and new--to bring its 
    1.1 million readers every aspect of the American past: great 
    men and scoundrels, popular music and high art, our grandest 
    national impulses and, occasionally, our basest. It all fits 
    into a fascinating, brightly-detailed survey of our shared 
    heritage that entertains even while it shows us how we got to 
    where we are--and points to where we may be going." --quote
